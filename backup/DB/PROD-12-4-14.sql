This was reported by <a href=\"http://klikki.fi/\">Jouko Pynnonen</a>. This issue does not affect version 4.0, but version 4.0.1 does address these eight security issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three cross-site scripting issues that a contributor or author could use to compromise a site. Discovered by <a href=\"http://joncave.co.uk/\">Jon Cave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.miqrogroove.com/\">Robert Chapin</a>, and <a href=\"https://johnblackbourn.com/\">John Blackbourn</a> of the WordPress security team.</li>\n<li>A cross-site request forgery that could be used to trick a user into changing their password.</li>\n<li>An issue that could lead to a denial of service when passwords are checked. Reported by <a href=\"http://www.behindthefirewalls.com/\">Javier Nieto Arevalo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.devconsole.info/\">Andres Rojas Guerrero</a>.</li>\n<li>Additional protections for server-side request forgery attacks when WordPress makes HTTP requests. Reported by Ben Bidner (vortfu).</li>\n<li>An extremely unlikely hash collision could allow a user&#8217;s account to be compromised, that also required that they haven&#8217;t logged in since 2008 (I wish I were kidding). Reported by <a href=\"http://david.dw-perspective.org.uk\">David Anderson</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress now invalidates the links in a password reset email if the user remembers their password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported separately by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MomenBassel\">Momen Bassel</a>, <a href=\"http://c0dehouse.blogspot.in/\">Tanoy Bose</a>, and <a href=\"https://managewp.com/\">Bojan Slavković of ManageWP</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 4.0.1 also fixes 23 bugs with 4.0, and we&#8217;ve made two hardening changes, including better validation of EXIF data we are extracting from uploaded photos. Reported by <a href=\"http://www.securesolutions.no/\">Chris Andrè Dale</a>.</p>\n<p>We appreciated the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security\">responsible disclosure</a> of these issues directly to our security team. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.0.1\">release notes</a> or consult the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.0?rev=30475&amp;stop_rev=29710\">list of changes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">Download WordPress 4.0.1</a> or venture over to <strong>Dashboard → Updates</strong> and simply click “Update Now”.</p>\n<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.1?

What if WordPress could recommend plugins based on the ones you have installed? Thanks to a <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\">recent update</a> to the API, users will be able to access a list of recommended plugins in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>The recommendations take into account the plugins you have installed and suggests plugins based on which ones are commonly used together. It&#8217;s similar to an e-commerce shopping cart that recommends products other customers have purchased based on what&#8217;s in the cart.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Plugins To Get its Own Tab</h2>\n<p>In today&#8217;s WordPress 4.1 developer meeting, the group <a title=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1417641723005178\" href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1417641723005178\">reached a consensus</a> to create a new tab for Recommended plugins instead of replacing the Popular tab. I&#8217;m in favor of this decision because they each have a different definition. Also, the Popular tab shows which plugins are doing well across the directory. Another benefit to keeping the Popular plugins tab is for fresh installs of WordPress, as it gives users a good foundation to start looking for plugins.</p>\n<p>In my tests, I noticed that some of the plugins recommended to me are 5-8 years old. I&#8217;ve reported the behavior to Alex Shiels and it will be addressed before 4.1 ships. If you are testing WordPress 4.1 and come across any oddities with plugin recommendations, please <a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337\">report them</a> in the ticket.</p>\n<p>The Recommended plugins tab exposes new and useful plugins to users instead of limiting them to the Featured and Popular categories. Since recommendations are based on actual data, they should get better as time goes on. Do you think a recommended plugins page is a useful addition to the plugin discovery process? Let us know in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Dec 2014 23:33:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Google’s New reCAPTCHA API Replaces Distorted Text with a Checkbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34808\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"http://wptavern.com/googles-new-recaptcha-api-replaces-distorted-text-with-a-checkbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3708:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/recaptcha.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34808]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/recaptcha.png?resize=365%2C109\" alt=\"recaptcha\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-34867\" /></a>For the past several years, Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha\" target=\"_blank\">reCAPTCHA</a> has verified a user&#8217;s humanity by forcing you to decipher warped, nonsensical text. reCAPTCHA&#8217;s method of protecting websites from spam has long put the burden on the user to prove that he is not an abusive bot.</p>\n<p>This is all about to change as a result of Google&#8217;s most <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/04/street-view-and-recaptcha-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent research</a>, which indicates that smart bots are able to solve even the most distorted text puzzles with more than 99% accuracy. Since the CAPTCHA puzzles are often infuriating to humans and ineffective at stopping bots, Google put its efforts toward developing a better user experience.</p>\n<p>Today, Vinay Shet, Google&#8217;s Product Manager for reCAPTCHA, <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> a new API called “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA.” This API utilizes an Advanced Risk Analysis engine that is capable of discerning between users and bots. The best part is that the interface has been simplified to a checkbox, a vast improvement over reCAPTCHA&#8217;s alphabet soup scramble.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nocaptcha.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34808]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nocaptcha.gif?resize=616%2C164\" alt=\"photo credit: Google Online Security Blog\" class=\"size-full wp-image-34870\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html\">Google Online Security Blog</a>\n<p>WordPress.org is already using the new &#8220;No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA&#8221; API and, according to the announcement, is providing users with a faster registration experience:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Early adopters, like <a href=\"https://support.snapchat.com/login2?next=/\" target=\"_blank\">Snapchat</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/register.php\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Humble Bundle</a>, and several others are already seeing great results with this new API. For example, in the last week, more than 60% of WordPress’ traffic and more than 80% of Humble Bundle’s traffic on reCAPTCHA encountered the No CAPTCHA experience—users got to these sites faster.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several dozen WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=reCAPTCHA\" target=\"_blank\">plugins integrate reCAPTCHA</a> in one way or another to protect sites from bad bots. Plugins that integrate the new &#8220;No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA&#8221; API will allow many users to pass through by simply checking a box. However, it does provide a fallback to the scrambled letters in cases where the Advanced Risk Analysis engine isn&#8217;t able to confidently assume that a user is human.</p>\n<p>A cursory examination of the changelogs on several reCAPTCHA plugins shows that plugin authors have not yet updated their extensions to indicate compatibility with the new API.

The more developed south and southeast regions of Brazil have had WordCamps in the past, but WordCamp Salvador will be the first in the northeast.</p>\n<p>Co-organizer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/leobaiano/\" target=\"_blank\">Leo Baiano</a> is the founder of Salvador&#8217;s first WordPress meetup group and has been instrumental in growing the local community over the past year. He discovered WordPress nine years ago, which led him to get involved in fostering his local community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea of holding WordCamp Salvador was born in early 2014. Many people have left the city to work in more technologically advanced cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where there are many events happening and more companies value employees,&#8221; he said. Baiano became determined to bring WordCamp to Salvador. &#8220;I did not want to leave the city that I love to participate in important events and be valued as a professional; I prefer to fight to make things better here,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>When Baiano started the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/wpsalvador/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Salvador/Bahia meetup group</a>, he focused on bringing people together for small events with lectures on basic topics, as well as social gatherings. They hosted approximately 10 meetups before sending in an application to start organizing a WordCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Without the meetups and the local community support, it would be almost impossible to make this WordCamp happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now I have a team of five local co-organizers and lots of others willing to volunteer at the event.&#8221; Baiano also received help from friends who organized previous WordCamps as well as support from the <a href=\"http://guwp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Brazil User Group</a>.</p>\n<h3>WP Salvador Meetup Group Helps Seniors Learn WordPress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wp-salvador-seniors.jpeg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34811]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wp-salvador-seniors.jpeg?resize=660%2C362\" alt=\"wp-salvador-seniors\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34834\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the unique things about the local WordPress community in Salvador is its desire to work together to help more people benefit from the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Local Brazilian communities are all similar in essence, but what differentiates the Salvador community from others is the willingness we all have to get the group together and work on related projects,&#8221; Baiano said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An example of that is this work we just started with this elderly group. Other group members already showed interest in running some workshops for them, without any financial return, just for the pleasure of working together.&#8221; The meetup group partnered with UNEB (State University of Bahia) and the UATI, a support unit for seniors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are teaching seniors how to create blogs with WordPress, and update and promote their blogs. This is a wonderful initiative because these seniors are looking for an occupation, something to pass the time, and they are very smart and interested in the lecture,&#8221; Baiano said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was surprised by their enthusiasm, all the time asking questions and wanting to learn more about it. In 2015 we will begin a series of workshops where this group of seniors will learn how to create a WordPress blog, how to produce content, basic SEO techniques such as promoting posts on social networks, how to increase the audience of the blog by interacting with readers and other blogs in the same niche.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Salvador Signifies an Important Milestone for the Local Community</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wp-salvador-meetup.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34811]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wp-salvador-meetup.jpg?resize=1025%2C589\" alt=\"wp-salvador-meetup\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34845\" /></a></p>\n<p>The local WordPress community in Salvador is just starting to take off, as meetup members gather around collaborative projects like the initiative to help seniors with WordPress. WordCamp Salvador will be an important milestone for solidifying the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My hope for this WordCamp is that it allows the community to grow even more, resulting in more people attending our future meetups and inspiring new collaborative projects,&#8221; Baiano said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The event happening this year is very important if you take into account the momentum of the digital market in the city of Salvador right now.

The framework is programmed entirely in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29\">Java</a> aimed at wide accessibility and quick deployment to desktop, web, and mobile platforms. Established in 2003, the jMonkeyEngine community forum has gone through at least four migrations.</p>\n<p>phpBB → SMF → BuddyPress Forum → bbPress 2.0 → Discourse.</p>\n<p>In late October, the jMonkeyEngine community hub went offline. When the site came back online, the team discovered performance issues. Due to performance reasons and a change in philosophy, the <a title=\"http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/\" href=\"http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/\">jMonkeyEngine project</a> is migrating its community and forum from <a title=\"http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/2014/11/we-will-be-moving-soon/\" href=\"http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/2014/11/we-will-be-moving-soon/\">BuddyPress and bbPress to Discourse</a>. This marks the fifth different forum migration in 10 years.</p>\n<h2>Why BuddyPress and bbPress Were Initially Chosen to Run The Community Hub</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34733]\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-30655 size-medium\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?resize=300%2C142\" alt=\"buddypress-logo-blue\" /></a>In a <a title=\"blog.erlend.sh/foundation-redefined-going-back-to-specialised-applications/\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/blog.erlend.sh/foundation-redefined-going-back-to-specialised-applications/\">post announcing</a> the change, jMonkeyEngine Community Manager, Erlend Sogge Heggen, cites the biggest mistake he made is using the forum component bundled with BuddyPress. In his grand vision for the site in 2010, Heggen envisioned the community site to have the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forums</li>\n<li>Social</li>\n<li>Galleries</li>\n<li>Wikis</li>\n<li>Files</li>\n<li>Advanced user profiles</li>\n<li>Unified search</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BuddyPress was chosen because it offers many of these features out of the box and integrates seamlessly with WordPress user tables. Over time, two particular problems arose.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No one on the community management team would touch the BuddyPress code because of its complexity.</li>\n<li>Even though BuddyPress has the features Heggen wants, it doesn&#8217;t do any of them particularly well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This brought about the realization that his community didn&#8217;t care for the galleries, wikis, or the advanced user profiles. Heggen says it&#8217;s the forum user&#8217;s cared about most, &#8220;So now we were stuck with a sub-par forum that everyone used, and a bunch of other sub-par features that no one used. In pursuit of the all-encompassing solution, I had downgraded the heart and soul of our website, and by extension our community: The forum.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Separate Software For Specific Tasks</h2>\n<p>Heggen says they&#8217;ll continue to use WordPress for now, but only for blogging. &#8220;The only users WordPress will handle is our small team of authors; it really isn&#8217;t designed well for anything other than administrative use anyhow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead of using software that fulfills multiple purposes, Heggen will use software specific to the task at hand and use APIs to bridge them together. &#8220;In the age of JSON APIs and SPAs, you don&#8217;t need that &#8216;one foundation to rule them all.\'&#8221;</p>\n<h2>When is bbPress The Right Choice?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bbpress.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34733]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-24338\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/bbpress.png?resize=500%2C184\" alt=\"bbpress\" /></a></p>\n<p>jMonkeyEngine has determined that BuddyPress and bbPress are no longer the right choice to build its community on. In a <a title=\"http://blog.erlend.sh/when-is-bbpress-the-right-choice/\" href=\"http://blog.erlend.sh/when-is-bbpress-the-right-choice/\">follow up post</a>, Heggen asks, is bbPress even right for anyone? According to Heggen, the custom post type is a lie and the project never gets the attention it deserves. &#8220;It&#8217;s under the official WordPress umbrella, but it&#8217;s not part of their product strategy, so in effect it&#8217;s just another plugin developed by hobbyists in their spare time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unlike bbPress, <a title=\"http://www.discourse.org/\" href=\"http://www.discourse.org/\">Discourse</a> has a team of paid developers working full-time to create the best community engagement/discussion software on the web. In less than two years, it looks and feels light-years beyond what bbPress offers. It&#8217;s worth noting that, like bbPress, Discourse is <a title=\"http://www.discourse.org/faq/#license\" href=\"http://www.discourse.org/faq/#license\">GPLv2 licensed</a>.</p>\n<p>Heggen recommends using bbPress only if it&#8217;s going to be a small subset of the site&#8217;s entire offering but says, &#8220;You should strongly reconsider whether it&#8217;s worth having a forum at all, because in my honest opinion a forum is an &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; sort of deal. It&#8217;s either a key component of your website, or it&#8217;s going to become a graveyard quicker than you can say &#8216;Welcome to our community!\'&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Still Hopeful For bbPress&#8217; Future</h2>\n<p>Despite moving the jMonkeyEngine community off of bbPress to Discourse and his gripes about the project, Heggen believes it can still be a viable competitor, &#8220;I still firmly believe in bbPress as a competitor to the likes of Muut and Disqus. It hasn&#8217;t lived up to its potential yet, but with a full-time developer, it very well could.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If John James Jacoby&#8217;s <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\">Indiegogo campaign</a> is successful, there will be at least one paid full-time developer to work on both bbPress and BuddyPress for the next six months. With nine days left, he still needs over $5,700 to reach his goal.</p>\n<h2>Community Engagement Crossroads</h2>\n<p>Automattic, the WordPress project, and bbPress are at a crossroad. The comment system in WordPress leaves a <a title=\"http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/\" href=\"http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/\">lot to be desired</a> and could use some serious improvements. Meanwhile, Automattic is sitting on a dormant <a title=\"http://intensedebate.com/\" href=\"http://intensedebate.com/\">commenting service</a> that hasn&#8217;t made any progress in years. bbPress development continues at a snail&#8217;s pace since it doesn&#8217;t have a committed team of developers and there are no signs of improvement on the horizon, outside of Jacoby&#8217;s campaign.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite quotes from Matt Mullenweg is from 2008, when Automattic acquired IntenseDebate. In <a title=\"http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/\">the announcement</a>, Mullenweg said the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Long-term, I think that comments are the most crucial interaction point for blogs, and an area that deserves a lot of investment and innovation. Comments really haven’t changed in a decade, and it’s time to spice things up a little.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I realize 2008 was a different time on the web, but in six years, I&#8217;ve seen very little innovation with comments. Instead, large sites are <a title=\"http://www.top5seo.co.uk/copyblogger-comments/\" href=\"http://www.top5seo.co.uk/copyblogger-comments/\">shutting them off</a> or moving to third-party services such as Disqus and <a title=\"http://web.livefyre.com/comments/\" href=\"http://web.livefyre.com/comments/\">Livefyre</a>. Jetpack Comments isn&#8217;t the solution because it&#8217;s just an iframe that is not easily extendable by other plugins.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what the answer is to having a great community engagement/discussion experience in WordPress but Jetpack Comments, bbPress, IntenseDebate, and the native comment system isn&#8217;t cutting it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Dec 2014 06:57:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: InfiniteWP Client Plugin Releases Security Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34791\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"http://wptavern.com/infinitewp-client-plugin-releases-security-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1789:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/InfiniteWPBannerHeader.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34791]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-34792\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/InfiniteWPBannerHeader.png?resize=500%2C160\" alt=\"InfiniteWP Banner Header\" /></a>If you use the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/iwp-client/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/iwp-client/\">InfiniteWP Client</a> plugin, log into your sites and check for updates.

Consequently, plugins that extend these themes for wedding-specific functionality are not as common as plugins for portfolios, testimonials, recipes, etc. If you develop wedding themes, you may want to check out <a href=\"http://themebeans.com/plugins/bean-registry/\" target=\"_blank\">Bean Registry</a>, a new free plugin created by the folks at <a href=\"http://themebeans.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeBeans</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/registry-plugin.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34692]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/registry-plugin.jpg?resize=1025%2C660\" alt=\"registry-plugin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34760\" /></a></p>\n<p>Adding links to registries is a common request for wedding themes, but it usually requires pasting a block of code into a page or hunting down logos and trying to size them to look nice with the theme. Bean Registry offers an attractive and convenient way to place and link store logos within the WordPress post editor.</p>\n<p>Once installed, the plugin adds a new button to the visual editor where the user can select from a dropdown list of the most common stores where people register.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/registry-shortcode.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34692]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/registry-shortcode.jpg?resize=750%2C595\" alt=\"registry-shortcode\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34756\" /></a></p>\n<p>This will automatically insert the correct shortcode and the user can then paste the registry link into the URL attribute.</p>\n<p>The resulting display on the frontend will look different, depending on what theme you&#8217;re using. The example below is from an unmodified version of Twenty Fifteen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/registry-frontend.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34692]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/registry-frontend.jpg?resize=901%2C646\" alt=\"registry-frontend\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34757\" /></a></p>\n<p>ThemeBeans developed the plugin for use with its new Emma wedding theme, which includes a <a href=\"http://demo.themebeans.com/?theme=Emma\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> of Bean Registry in action. Because it was created for a wedding theme, the 18 stores currently included in the plugin mostly cater to weddings. After receiving some initial feedback, ThemeBeans plans to add more baby stores to the list. Future versions of the plugin will make it more flexible for use with baby showers and announcements.</p>\n<p>The Bean Registry plugin could be a handy tool for WordPress theme developers who want to include support for it in their wedding themes.

He also recently created an <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hhvm-for-varying-vagrant-vagrants-wordpress-development-on-speed\" target=\"_blank\">HHVM configuration for Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a>, which makes it easy to test WordPress on HHVM in a local development environment.</p>\n<h3>Taking a Chance on BuddyPress</h3>\n<p>WP Engine is sponsoring the HHVM + BuddyPress compatibility work as part of its <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/labs\" target=\"_blank\">Labs project</a>, headed up by Tomas Puig. Labs is a separate team within the company that works on new technologies and open source contribution. &#8220;Right now we can&#8217;t even load test BuddyPress without it breaking,&#8221; Puig said.</p>\n<p>Why is WP Engine prioritizing BuddyPress compatibility with HHVM? The company is taking a chance on WordPress&#8217; premier social networking plugin and, if successful, will become the fastest hosting platform available for running BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We saw such a surge of interest when we announced Mercury. We don&#8217;t have a lot of BuddyPress customers,&#8221; Puig told the Tavern. &#8220;But I think if we get BuddyPress performing well for HHVM, then people will want to use it even more. Also, core and bbPress work great with HHVM so we felt the third project should too, so everyone can benefit.&#8221; The technical objectives of the compatibility effort are to get BuddyPress working at parity with how it currently runs on PHP-FPM.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my mind i&#8217;d love to see the major WP projects work with it,&#8221; Puig said. &#8220;If we see a 3-8x improvement in speed, it&#8217;s going help everyone trying to deploy BuddyPress. Also, I think more people will use it if it&#8217;s easier to support high user loads.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Puig did not have immediate access to the number of WP Engine customers currently running BuddyPress, but he said the company will continue with the investment regardless of small usage numbers. &#8220;Technology, once it&#8217;s a performant, great option, will get adopted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But once the main body of work and the tests are built it gets much easier to keep that way moving forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Engine is engaging the Facebook team on the effort as well, as there might be things in HHVM that are preventing it from being compatible with BuddyPress. The company contracted Jacoby to work on the project for the month of December, before he gets started on the new year with his <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress development</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit unknown how much code needs to change to make it HHVM compliant, so we wanted the person who is the most familiar with the code base,&#8221; Puig said.</p>\n<p>WP Engine sponsoring Jacoby to work on this initiative benefits the open source BuddyPress plugin in a couple of major ways. In addition to supporting the project lead in working with the software, the HHVM compatibility project also ensures the future of BuddyPress working with modern technologies. Many believe that HHVM is going to revolutionize PHP, which means that hosting companies will soon be rushing to adopt it. Investing in BuddyPress compatibility with HHVM now means that the plugin won&#8217;t be left in the dust.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Dec 2014 22:28:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: How to Send a Quick Email With an Attachment From The WordPress Admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34682\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-send-a-quick-email-with-an-attachment-from-the-wordpress-admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2150:\"<p>If you&#8217;d like to be able to send a quick email from the backend of WordPress, the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-mail/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-mail/\">Quick Mail</a> plugin developed by <a title=\"http://wheredidmybraingo.com\" href=\"http://wheredidmybraingo.com\">Mitchell D.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> has now been downloaded more than 13 million times. It is widely used and even comes installed by default on many hosts that offer a 1-click WordPress installation option.</p>\n<p>In early 2011, few could have predicted that Jetpack would grow to house 33 modules, each of which could technically be its own plugin. Because the Jetpack family of modules has grown to such a large number, the settings page now includes multiple ways to filter the modules in addition to a module search box.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the Jetpack team has made great strides towards <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-0-released-adds-bulk-module-management-site-verification-and-twitter-open-graph-support\" target=\"_blank\">improving the settings interface</a> to support easy deactivation of unused modules, many WordPress users have reservations about using it.</p>\n<h3>JP Bot Provides Alternatives to Popular Jetpack Modules</h3>\n<p>Jetpack&#8217;s ever-growing codebase has prompted many WordPress users to seek out and create alternatives to some of its best features. A couple weeks ago, we featured <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/get-jetpacks-markdown-module-without-using-jetpack\" target=\"_blank\">JP Markdown</a>, a plugin that duplicates Jetpack&#8217;s markdown module. It was created by web engineer <a href=\"http://ahs.pw/\" target=\"_blank\">Anas Sulaiman</a> who is the face behind <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpjp/\" target=\"_blank\">JP Bot</a>, the WordPress.org account dedicated to his collection of Jetpack-extraction plugins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jp-bot-plugins.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34615]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jp-bot-plugins.jpg?resize=700%2C222\" alt=\"jp-bot-plugins\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33603\" /></a></p>\n<p>I spoke with Sulaiman to find out his motivation for performing the extractions. His work began with an appreciation of Jetpack. &#8220;I really liked some of its modules, but not others. I also didn&#8217;t like having to install a bunch of plugins (modules in terms of Jetpack) that I never used,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Sulaiman decided to dive into the Jetpack code and make it work the way he wanted, taking full advantage of the plugin&#8217;s GPL licensing. &#8220;A couple of days later, I had four modules of Jetpack running as standalone plugins on my WordPress installation. It started with Jetpack Sharing, Jetpack Gravatar Hovercards, Jetpack Omnisearch, and Jetpack Widget Visibility. Later on, I decided it would be nice to share these plugins,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Sulaiman has now released six Jetpack-extraction plugins under the JP Bot account. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like calling these plugins mine. I merely copied code from Jetpack, with very few modifications,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>What specific changes does he make when he duplicates the modules? Sulaiman said that the process of converting a Jetpack module into a standalone plugin is fairly simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Copy all related files into a new folder.</li>\n<li>Scan the code and remove any Jetpack dependencies. It could be commenting out some lines of code or editing others. There is no lost functionality. If a module is dependent on other parts of Jetpack, those other parts are copied over and the lines of code that depend on them are edited to correct references.</li>\n<li>Add a link to the settings page, i.e. &#8220;Settings&#8221; for Jetpack Sharing and &#8220;Go to Widgets&#8221; for Jetpack Widget Visibility.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>WordPress users who appreciate Jetpack&#8217;s features, but have reservations about connecting to a third-party service, will find that the JP Bot plugins are a suitable alternative. The most important consideration is whether or not these plugins will be maintained and updated to reflect changes made to Jetpack.</p>\n<p>Sulaiman told the Tavern that he will make every effort to maintain his extractions but admits there may be some delays.

However, it should be noted that Jetpack team doesn&#8217;t like providing support for others&#8217; plugins.&#8221; Sulaiman advises users to request support from Jetpack based on the original module in question, instead of referencing the JP Bot plugin.</p>\n<p>While he plans to share future Jetpack extractions with users and keep his plugins updated, Sulaiman hopes that users will understand his desire to remain in the background with no obligation of support. &#8220;For this and that, all JP plugins are now maintained by the JP Bot &#8211; a dedicated, intelligent, friendly and silent bot!&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Dec 2014 02:09:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: DawnPatrol Gives Fringe WordPress Communities a Voice\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=32822\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wptavern.com/dawnpatrol-gives-fringe-wordpress-communities-a-voice\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3225:\"<p><a title=\"http://dawnpatrol.io/\" href=\"http://dawnpatrol.io/\">DawnPatrol</a> is a new project by Scott Basgaard and Noel Tock of <a title=\"http://hmn.md/\" href=\"http://hmn.md/\">HumanMade.</a> The site is billed as a <em>community experiment</em> that features video clips of WordCamp participants from across the world.

Unlike posts, pages are not arranged chronologically, but are instead interrelated with other pages by hierarchy. Some sites have hundreds or even thousands of parent and child pages.</p>\n<p>WordPress includes a very simple UI for indicating if a page is a subpage, but moving pages around within that structure can be a cumbersome process. That&#8217;s why developer <a href=\"https://github.com/kylephillips\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Phillips</a> decided to create the <a href=\"http://nestedpages.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nested Pages</a> plugin, which offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for page management. The plugin revamps the pages screen to make it cleaner and more user friendly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nestedpages-screenshot.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34553]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nestedpages-screenshot.png?resize=741%2C516\" alt=\"nestedpages-screenshot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34587\" /></a></p>\n<p>Nested Pages arranges the page list in an expandable, sortable tree view where individual pages can be dragged into place. The UI is also touch-friendly, so mobile users can tap and drag to manage pages. It works in a similar way to WordPress&#8217; menu system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sorting-pages.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34553]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sorting-pages.gif?resize=1025%2C586\" alt=\"sorting-pages\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34578\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I work on client sites full-time, and many times those sites have large page hierarchies that are difficult to manage within the native Pages listing,&#8221; Phillips said. &#8220;This proved to be a frustration point with clients.</p>\n<p>Nested Pages is unique in that it maintains the availability of the Quick Edit feature in the revamped pages interface with all the standard fields and a few extra custom fields for setting menu and visibility options. &#8220;While there are many &#8216;drag-and-drop&#8217; page administration plugins available, I could not find any that maintained quick edit functionality and did so in a clean, intuitive way,&#8221; Phillips said, explaining his inspiration for creating the plugin.</p>\n<p>Nested Pages also has a convenient feature where it will generate a native WordPress menu automatically to match your pages screen. &#8220;In designing the plugin, I was definitely inspired by the way other content management systems tackled this problem,&#8221; Phillips said. &#8220;In keeping with the &#8216;WordPress way&#8217;, I decided to include a menu that automatically synchronizes with page changes (while providing menu editing within the Quick Edit interface).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nestedpages-wordpress-auto-menu.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34553]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nestedpages-wordpress-auto-menu.png?resize=729%2C485\" alt=\"nestedpages-wordpress-auto-menu\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34596\" /></a></p>\n<p>So far, Phillips said the plugin has been well received since he released it a few weeks ago. Since that time, he has worked out a few small bugs and design considerations. &#8220;I&#8217;ve included the plugin in all my client work recently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Clients have all assumed that it was part of the native WordPress interface (which I can only take as a good sign).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nested Pages requires WordPress 3.8 or higher, and PHP version 5.3+. After testing the plugin, I found that it works smoothly, as page sorting and nesting are both saved in the background as you make changes to the structure. The plugin provides an elegant implementation of drag-and-drop page management and has the added benefit of cleaning up the pages screen with the expandable tree view. Phillips has incorporated all of these features while making it look like a natural part of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Nested pages is one of the best CMS-enhancing plugins I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-nested-pages/\" target=\"_blank\">download</a> it directly from WordPress.org.

The themes were designed and developed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_robbieobbie\" target=\"_blank\">Robbie Grabowski</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m2thedris\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Driscoll</a>, the folks behind a group of agencies that specialize in custom WordPress work. The duo created the site in order to make modern themes and give back to the web community.</p>\n<p>Currently, ModernThemes offers a dozen free <a href=\"http://modernthemes.net/wordpress-themes/\" target=\"_blank\">themes</a> in multiple categories, including video, resume, e-commerce, business, and portfolio. They plan to add new themes every month, and the next one on deck is a blogging theme for posting and sharing recipes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/modern-themes-collection.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34229]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/modern-themes-collection.jpg?resize=1025%2C844\" alt=\"modern-themes-collection\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34522\" /></a></p>\n<p>All of the themes are based on <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores</a> and the <a href=\"http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Grid</a>. Many of the themes offer support for WooCommerce, WordPress SEO, Advanced Custom Fields, and other various plugins. The team behind ModernThemes strives to keep theme and plugin functionality separate as much as possible. They aim to be plugin-friendly, as opposed to plugin-heavy.</p>\n<p>While the free themes offered on the site have beautiful, appealing designs, they would not be able to pass WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review\" target=\"_blank\">theme review guidelines</a>. A cursory sweep with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Check</a> plugin reveals a number of errors that would preclude ModernThemes&#8217; products from being listed in the WordPress.org Themes Directory.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, the themes utilize the native customizer exclusively, which will help them to keep pace with advancements in WordPress over time. When you install a theme from ModernThemes, you&#8217;ll find dozens of options available in the customizer for personalizing your site.</p>\n<p>Demo content for the themes is available in the zip file, but documentation seems rather sparse. Getting your site to look similar to the demo will require a bit of time spent in the customizer, tweaking various sections. ModernThemes offers a basic <a href=\"http://modernthemes.net/documentation/theme-customizer-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">video tutorial</a> on using the customizer to set up the themes.</p>\n<p>Free theme projects like this one tend to be influential in raising the bar for commercial theme developers. It will be interesting to see how long the ModernThemes team can sustain a free themes shop without any direct monetization. The project has plenty of potential and we&#8217;ll be watching to see how the site evolves in the coming year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 21:55:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Major Performance Improvements Coming to Jigoshop 2.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34454\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wptavern.com/major-performance-improvements-coming-to-jigoshop-2-0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3406:\"<p>The team behind the <a href=\"https://www.jigoshop.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jigoshop</a> e-commerce plugin has been working on the upcoming 2.0 release for the past four months. The open source <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jigoshop/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> was forked by WooThemes in 2011 to create the early foundation of WooCommerce and has now been downloaded nearly half a million times.</p>\n<p>If the 2.0 alpha version is any indication, this release promises to be a major improvement for Jigoshop users in terms of speed. The plugin has been completely rebuilt to include <a href=\"http://symfony.com/components/DependencyInjection\" target=\"_blank\">Symfony&#8217;s Dependency Injection component</a>, which decreases the impact on loading all of the logic to make everything faster. This also allows developers to override any Jigoshop class, load plugins using autoloading, and insert subpages and tabs for settings in the Jigoshop admin panel.</p>\n<p>As a result of the improvements, <strong>Jigoshop 2.0 is 3X times faster than 1.x</strong> when comparing the performance on common tasks such as browsing product list, adding items to the shopping cart, managing the cart, and placing an order. The team made these speed improvements without using real caching but also plan to make use of memcached and the WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API\" target=\"_blank\">Transients API</a> to decrease response times even further. Version 2.0 will also include support for modern tools, such as Gulp, Bower, and Composer, to automate tasks and manage dependencies.</p>\n<p>The upcoming release also includes a number of improvements to the interface, including a complete revamp of the settings. Automatic saving was added to many fields, both the admin and on the frontend. For example, when adding product attributes, you&#8217;ll find that it saves automatically.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jigoshop-product-attributes.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34454]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jigoshop-product-attributes.png?resize=1025%2C355\" alt=\"jigoshop-product-attributes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34481\" /></a></p>\n<p>The cart and checkout experiences have also been retooled with a more streamlined interface and purchasing process to help encourage users to buy. Individual product pages are sporting a new, more attractive design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jigoshop-product-page.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34454]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jigoshop-product-page.png?resize=1025%2C460\" alt=\"jigoshop-product-page\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34483\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Jigoshop team is still actively working out a number of features that they would like to see in 2.0, including variables, external and downloadable product types, additional settings, more default payment gateways and shipping methods, coupons implementation and My Account with My Orders pages.

Transitioning from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy\" target=\"_blank\">planned economy</a> to a market-driven economy was a challenge that Serbians have vigorously embraced over the past 20 years. Belgrade is now a growing center for information technology in Eastern Europe. In 2013, Serbia&#8217;s IT industry growth outpaced the rest of the economy <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d899fac-3a42-11e3-9243-00144feab7de.html#axzz3K6V1o15X\" target=\"_blank\">by nearly 200%</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise then that the WordPress community in Serbia is growing in tandem and bursting at the seams. While a small country in the Balkan Peninsula may seem like an unlikely place for a thriving WordPress community, conditions are now ripe for the very first <a href=\"http://2015.belgrade.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Belgrade</a>. The organizers&#8217; budget was approved last week and the event is officially set for the weekend of April 18-19.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe</a> I had the opportunity to meet several members of the Serbian WordPress community. While passing through Belgrade on my way out, I stopped in to spend time with community leaders <a href=\"http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/\" target=\"_blank\">Vladimir Prelovac</a> and <a href=\"http://lanche86.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Milan Ivanović</a>, who offered a glimpse into Serbia&#8217;s growing WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>From Zero to WordCamp in Under Two Years</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4-wpserbia-meetup.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34372]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4-wpserbia-meetup.jpg?resize=1025%2C684\" alt=\"4-wpserbia-meetup\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34402\" /></a></p>\n<p>Prelovac is a prolific plugin developer and founder of <a href=\"https://managewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ManageWP</a>, which was host to the first Serbian WordPress meetup in early 2013. Over the past two years, he&#8217;s watched the community go from virtually non-existent to hundreds of people.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress community in Serbia is very, very young. It all started with a meetup held in the ManageWP&#8217;s office in early 2013, which hosted around 30 interested people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But then it all went very fast from there. Three more meetups were organized since, with around 100 people attending each meetup.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a couple of weeks, the number of Serbian WP meetups will expand to five. The use of Meetup.com is not very popular in Serbia, so Facebook has been instrumental for organizing events. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/613503768679500/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Serbia Facebook group</a> counts nearly 600 members, many of whom will be in attendance at the upcoming WordCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress has been quickly recognized as a project that is easy to get involved with,&#8221; Prelovac said, commenting on the community&#8217;s growth. &#8220;People were eager to find out more on how they can contribute or start a business based on WordPress. For example, on the very first meetup we had the <a href=\"http://www.themeskingdom.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Themes Kingdom</a> guys speaking about their theme business, which spawned a couple of theme-based businesses, some of which are already very successful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also attributes the community&#8217;s growth to the energy and dedication of its organizers. &#8220;Milan Ivanović is leading the organization effort, as well as Marko Heijnen, who is playing an important role in making this community better known and recognized in the broader WordPress community. Our COO Ivan Bjelajac is also helping with logistics, promotion and local speakers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Milan Ivanović has been working with WordPress for six years. He is currently the Frontend Team Lead at <a href=\"http://www.razor.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">Razor Communications</a>, a Serbian-based digital agency, and is one of the organizers for WordCamp Serbia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People in Serbia saw the opportunity in getting hired remotely and that&#8217;s got to be the key to our rapid growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The open and helping community was also a solid foundation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the first WordCamp Europe in 2013, Ivanović met <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markoheijnen\" target=\"_blank\">Marko Heijnen</a>, and the two agreed to put more effort into pushing the local WordPress community. &#8220;At that very same WordCamp, I met <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dinicmilan\" target=\"_blank\">Milan Dinić</a> who, for the past seven years, has been helping with the Serbian version of WordPress and everything that comes with it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that time, the group started organizing and formed a team of people to help with future meetups. &#8220;Up to the second WordPress Meetup we wasn&#8217;t sure how many people would attend and we were shocked when around 100 showed up. We saw the same number of attendees at the following meetups,&#8221; Ivanović said.</p>\n<p>In May 2014, WordCamp Serbia organizers were approved to work on hosting a WordCamp in Belgrade. At the moment, they have capacity for 200 attendees.</p>\n<h3>Growing Job Market for WordPress Professionals in Serbia</h3>\n<p>The Belgrade metro area is home to approximately 1.65 million people, nestled between the Sava and Danube rivers. <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/index/country/serbia\" target=\"_blank\">Economic freedom is on the upswing</a>, which is one of the factors that make it an excellent place for businesses to thrive.</p>\n<p>While the area has many WordPress-based businesses, Prelovac said that most WordPress professionals elect to be freelancers, finding ample opportunities in the very diverse commercial market created by WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">It only took a couple of known WordPress local businesses to make the initial spark, and the community basically exploded from there</span>, growing, maturing and becoming an organization on its own in a very short period of time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ivanović shares the same outlook on Serbia&#8217;s job market for WordPress professionals. &#8220;Programming and development in general are blooming in Serbia and this whole region in the last couple of years. WordPress just caught that wave.</p>\n<p>&#8220;More people are turning to freelancing or starting their own business each day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although there are lot of companies and start-ups specialized in building either clients websites or selling premium themes, through WP Meetups I can see that overall interest in WordPress is growing fast and we will work and try our best to bring WordPress to even more people in Serbia and the region.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Prelovac, Serbian companies are very open to using open source software, especially startups. He has been at the helm of several successful commercial endeavors and believes that the region is ripe for entrepreneurs. &#8220;I&#8217;d say it was never better. The tech and startup scene in Serbia is blooming, giving a lot of opportunities to energetic, smart, and capable people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ivanović echos that recommendation. &#8220;My advice for all of them is to start WordPress business ASAP! No matter how hard we try, still there are lots of websites that needs redesigning, and WordPress is the best solution for clients, nine out of ten times,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in Serbia and top talent seems to be readily available to companies in the region. WordPress is becoming one of the most important factors in the improved economic outlook for freelancers and small businesses.</p>\n<h3>Working Together with Neighboring Tech Communities</h3>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WP-unites-countries.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34372]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WP-unites-countries.png?resize=1024%2C682\" alt=\"WordPress Communities of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia at WordCamp Europe 2014\" class=\"size-full wp-image-34426\" /></a>WordPress Communities of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia\n<p>The WordPress community in Serbia has a healthy relationship with neighboring communities, especially those in Croatia, Romania, and Bulgaria that share a similar history. &#8220;Our best relationship we have is with the PHP community in Serbia, but that one came pretty naturally for all of us,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a large percentage of the same visitors attending WordPress and PHP conferences and meetups.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress community also receives enormous support from the <a href=\"http://startit.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">Serbian Startup</a> community, which serves to encourage the local IT community to start innovative and successful entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>\n<p>The community is also well connected with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpcroatia\" target=\"_blank\">WP Croatia</a>, and the two groups are working on organizing a special event to bring the communities together.</p>\n<h3>The Future of the Serbian WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>Organizing the first WordCamp Belgrade comes with its own set of unique challenges, which Prelovac identified as &#8220;inviting interesting speakers, attracting people wanting to visit Serbia and meet with this new community as well as discover the beauties of our country.&#8221; Belgrade isn&#8217;t yet a popular tourist destination, so the event is likely to be very focused on the local community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordCamp will no doubt be a huge deal for the further expansion of the community. I expect it to have several thousand members by the end of the next year,&#8221; he predicted.</p>\n<p>Ivanović said he also predicts exponential growth as the result of bringing together the regional community for the event. &#8220;It feels like all the people here in Serbia and the whole region have been waiting for something to happen to make that small push over the edge and into community.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 23:23:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Where to Find WordPress Related Black Friday Deals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34422\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://wptavern.com/where-to-find-wordpress-related-black-friday-deals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1405:\"<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/BlackfridayFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34422]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-34430\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/BlackfridayFeaturedImage.png?resize=638%2C200\" alt=\"Black Friday Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/6575053747/\">kevin dooley</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>This is a great time of year if you&#8217;re in the market for themes, plugins, or webhosting.

This method works, but it comes with a couple of drawbacks. The option, found under the Settings → Discussion screen, is essentially an an all-or-nothing choice on older posts.</p>\n<p>The comment deadline setting is an unsparing guillotine that drops after a set number of days to cut off discussion, without regard for any conversations still in progress. The reality is that not all older content automatically becomes irrelevant after a set number of days. Certain posts may take months or even years to get found in the vast sea of content on the web. Moreover, some posts may not gain traction or ignite conversation until well after they were originally published.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/override-comment-deadline/\" target=\"_blank\">Override Comment Deadline</a> plugin was created to offer authors a little more flexibility to leave comments open on select posts after the deadline set in the discussion settings. It adds a new metabox to the post edit screen where you can check a box to keep comments open.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/override-comment-deadline.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34334]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/override-comment-deadline.png?resize=500%2C290\" alt=\"override-comment-deadline\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-34336\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottnelle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Nelle</a>, Application Developer at Union Street Media, created the plugin to do one simple thing- to keep comments open indefinitely on select posts. There&#8217;s no settings screen or anything else that needs to be configured. However, you will need to have assigned a number of days for automatically closing comments in the discussion settings in order for the plugin to be effective.</p>\n<p>Many large blogs are <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/why-comments-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\">turning off comments</a> because of the time-consuming tasks of moderation and spam management.

In no particular order, here are six things I&#8217;m thankful for when it comes to WordPress.</p>\n<h2>The Community</h2>\n<p>The WordPress community is a large reason for the project&#8217;s continued success. It&#8217;s filled with smart, passionate people, democratizing publishing on a global scale. WordPress is like an engine and the community is the oil. Without the community, the project would likely not be as large and successful as it is today.</p>\n<h2>WordPress, Plugin, and Theme Developers</h2>\n<p>Developers are the people who create solutions to problems. Thank you for everything that you do to help WordPress be a better project whether it&#8217;s through themes, plugins, or core contributions. I especially thank those who contribute to the project without being paid for it. WordPress wouldn&#8217;t be the same if it weren&#8217;t for the generosity of so many developers.</p>\n<h2>Support Forum Volunteers</h2>\n<p>The people who volunteer time on the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">WordPress support forums</a> are special. To millions of users, they represent the front line of the project. Most of them are not paid and provide support as a means of contributing to WordPress. Several support queries are resolved each week because of their dedication.</p>\n<h2>Meetup/WordCamp Organizers</h2>\n<p>Meetups bring users together to interact and learn about WordPress. They&#8217;re an important part of the community and project. WordCamps are a huge undertaking and provide great opportunities for local communities to learn about WordPress. Not everyone has the skills to organize these events. It takes someone with passion, dedication, energy, and time. Thank you to everyone who has played a role in organizing either a meetup or WordCamp.</p>\n<h2>Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg</h2>\n<p>If Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little did not <a title=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">fork of b2 in 2003</a>, WordPress may not exist. Thank you both for getting the ball rolling in 2003.</p>\n<h2>WP Tavern Supporters</h2>\n<p>Last but not least, thank you to those who continue to read the Tavern on a daily basis and support the work we do. Whether it&#8217;s commenting on articles, interacting with us on Twitter, or listening to <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/category/wordpress-weekly\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/category/wordpress-weekly\">WordPress Weekly</a>, your involvement with the Tavern is an important part of the site&#8217;s success.</p>\n<h2>What Are You Thankful For?</h2>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t celebrate Thanksgiving, there&#8217;s probably a few things you&#8217;re thankful for when it comes to WordPress. Tell us about them in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 03:05:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.2 on Track to Provide a Basic Member Type API\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33950\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-on-track-to-provide-a-basic-member-type-api\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3403:\"<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/different-users.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33950]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/different-users.jpg?resize=1024%2C492\" alt=\"photo credit: Dunechaser - cc\" class=\"size-full wp-image-30565\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dunechaser/6042984689/\">Dunechaser</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>BuddyPress 2.2 is under active development and contributors are close to having the basics of a new Member Type API on board for the upcoming release. The new API would allow developers to separate users into different types, a common request for many BuddyPress-powered communities. User types make it possible to create some interesting community features, such as restricting content, filtering the member directory, assigning different permissions, and displaying profiles in a unique way for different types of members.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress lead developer <a href=\"http://boone.gorg.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Boone Gorges</a> proposed the enhancement in a <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6006\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> that outlines developers&#8217; need for this API. <strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for BP to provide the basics of a User Type API, so that plugin devs and site builders will have some common tools for building the user type functionality required by their implementation,&#8221;</strong> Gorges said.</p>\n<p>In the past, Gorges, like many others, used xprofile, taxonomies, and usermeta to create user types. For BuddyPress 2.2, he is proposing that BP register a private taxonomy <code>\'bp_user_type\'</code>. Registering a member type would require a new function. Gorges&#8217; first pass at the member type API adds <code>bp_register_member_type( $type, $args )</code>, with syntax similar to what you might use to register a custom post type or a custom taxonomy. Gorges provided an <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6006/bp-member-type-test.php\" target=\"_blank\">example mu-plugin</a> to demonstrate how simple it will be to register a new member type.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the UI for the Member Type API is very basic. When member types have been registered, you will see a meta box added to the community profile screen in the admin. This will allow admins to change a user&#8217;s member type, which is currently limited to one. The 2.2 release may ship with support for one member type or it may support multiple types, depending on how the feature evolves during this development cycle.</p>\n<p>The Member Type API won&#8217;t actually do anything visible for users in the first iteration. It&#8217;s purely a feature for developers that will enable them to build their own interfaces for creating and managing user types. The idea has been well-received by BuddyPress developers who are excited to have a standard way to accomplish user type requests that are common to building niche social networks.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress 2.2 is expected at the end of January 2015. The Member Type API isn&#8217;t yet a lock but appears to be on track for inclusion in the next release.

The conference, devoted solely to WooCommerce, sold out with 300 attendees. The plugin had 294 contributors on its most recent 2.2 release and is currently being used on 18% of all e-commerce sites on the web.</p>\n<p>Building on the global success of the plugin and its many commercial <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/\" target=\"_blank\">extensions</a>, the folks at WooThemes are now branching out into selling theme extensions for the new official WooCommerce theme. <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/storefront/\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a> landed in the WordPress Themes Directory last week and already has three commercial <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/storefront-extensions/\" target=\"_blank\">extensions</a> available.</p>\n<p>Although the theme appears to be very plain, it&#8217;s meant to be a starting place that includes deep WooCommerce integration. Storefront was designed to be lean, extensible, and an example of WooCommerce theme development standards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/storefront.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34038]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/storefront.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"storefront\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34259\" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme does not include any sliders, shortcodes, or page builders but exists to promote a more modular approach building e-commerce sites. Instead of dumping a bunch of functionality into the theme, WooThemes opted to keep it a simple foundation for building WooCommerce projects.</p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Storefront is completely bare bones. In fact, it includes an impressive array of options built into WordPress&#8217; native customizer. Users can easily customize the background color/image, header image, footer colors (header, text, link, and background), button colors, and site layout. Storefront was built to be responsive and offers multiple widget areas for further customization, including sidebar, header, and four areas in the footer. The <a href=\"http://demo2.woothemes.com/storefront/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> features example products and a custom header in place.</p>\n<p>WooThemes used the <a href=\"http://underscores.me\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores</a> starter theme to build Storefront. Users can upload a custom logo by adding Jetpack, as the theme includes support for the new <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-2-released-introduces-new-site-logo-feature-for-theme-developers\" target=\"_blank\">site logo feature</a>.</p>\n<p>With the help of WooTheme&#8217;s free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/homepage-control/\" target=\"_blank\">Homepage Control</a> plugin, it&#8217;s easy to customize the appearance and arrangement of featured products, categories, recent products, sale items, popular products, etc.</p>\n<p>Storefront also includes deep integration for WooCommerce&#8217;s most popular extensions, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Bookings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-wishlists/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Wishlists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/brands/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Brands</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Subscriptions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theme developers looking to build products that integrate with these extensions need look no further than the official Storefront theme. It was created to be a prime example.</p>\n<p>The WooCommerce team built Storefront with data portability in mind, so that users will be able to easily switch themes without losing their content. That&#8217;s why they opted not to include any extra functionality in the theme, as explained in the release announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By not including these features you’re free to add them via whichever plugin you prefer, and if/when you switch themes later on down the road all of those features will remain. We firmly believe that building Storefront this way means you will be less likely to need or want to switch, but at the same time wholeheartedly encourage the entrepreneurial opportunity that WooCommerce offers for theme developers far and wide.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With WooCommerce leading the WordPress e-commerce market, this theme should help to provide a standard reference for developers integrating the plugin&#8217;s features and its extensions with themes. If the popularity of the core plugin and its extensions are any indication, the launch of Storefront should accelerate the creation of new designs and ignite developers to start building new products for the theme.

Custom post types ushered in a new era that allowed plugin developers to create and organize content in a more modular way.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to explain the concept of custom post types to someone, you may have found that they are more easily understood as <em>custom content types</em>. One thing that makes them confusing is the fact that are usually found floating around in the admin as top level menu items. Custom post types often have no context, which makes it difficult to know how they will appear on the frontend of your site.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hierarchy/\" title=\"Hierarchy Plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Hierarchy</a> plugin aims to solve this problem by moving custom post type admin menus into your pages list. Ordinarily, CPTs have their own menu items and the page menu structure doesn&#8217;t accurately reflect where the content is located, as shown in the example below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cpt-admin.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34072]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cpt-admin.png?resize=1025%2C642\" alt=\"cpt-admin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34153\" /></a></p>\n<p>Custom post types are often used to power various sections of a website. Hierarchy works to improve the content editing workflow by intelligently including custom post type admin links within the page structure. In place of the Pages menu in the admin you&#8217;ll see a new Content menu, with custom post types, such as locations, people, and knowledgebase, added under their corresponding pages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hierarchy-in-action.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34072]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hierarchy-in-action.png?resize=1025%2C642\" alt=\"hierarchy-in-action\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34182\" /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.0 of the plugin includes Dashicons support and a button to add a new page. Each content type is displayed with contextual links within the hierarchical view of content. You can hover over an entry to display the edit, view, and taxonomy links.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hierarchy-contextual-links.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34072]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hierarchy-contextual-links.png?resize=1025%2C267\" alt=\"hierarchy-contextual-links\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34188\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hierarchy also includes a settings page that allows you to designate which custom post types will be included in the hierarchy display, as well as the ability to disable new entries and set the menu order. You can also elect to hide CPTs from the admin menu so that they only show up within the Hierarchy structure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hierarchy-settings.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34072]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hierarchy-settings.png?resize=1025%2C986\" alt=\"hierarchy-settings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34189\" /></a></p>\n<p>When WordPress is used primarily as a CMS, pages often become the backbone for organizing the site&#8217;s content. This plugin addresses the lack of hierarchical structure in the admin. <a href=\"https://mondaybynoon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Christopher</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://searchwp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SearchWP</a>, wrote Hierarchy two years ago and has found it to be indispensable when creating websites for clients. He released version 1.0 of the plugin this week, which is essentially a complete rewrite of the previous version.

For example, <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cool-video-gallery/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cool-video-gallery/\">Cool Video Gallery</a> is broken because of the way it handles custom shortcode attribute parsing instead of using the <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API\">Shortcode API</a> built into WordPress. Mika Epstein, who is a support forum volunteer, <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/issues-with-wordpress-401-and-shortcodes\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/issues-with-wordpress-401-and-shortcodes\">published a post</a> in the support forum that explains the problem and the best way to fix it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;ve upgraded to WordPress 4.0.1 and a feature using shortcodes has broken (like a slider, or a visual composer), the reason is that code wasn&#8217;t properly using the WP Shortcode API.</p>\n<p>Code that parsed shortcodes themselves, instead of using the normal add_shortcode handlers and such, may be surprised by the new behavior of texturize, because the quote marks in what WP thinks isn&#8217;t a shortcode get texturized now like everything else. So their filters, which probably come after texturize, don&#8217;t get the expected quote marks.</p>\n<p>For users, the best way to fix this is upgrade. Many plugins have already released fixes, more are on the way. While it is possible to downgrade to WP 4.0, we really hope you don&#8217;t because of how serious the security fixes were. If you absolutely MUST downgrade, please nag your plugin/theme devs a lot to fix this STAT. Or stop using their stuff. It&#8217;s that big.</p>\n<p>For developers, if you&#8217;re making shortcodes, use the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API\">Shortcode API</a> instead of rolling your own.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a title=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29557\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29557\">Ticket 29557</a> in Trac describes the issue in detail. Unfortunately, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-1-is-a-critical-security-release-that-fixes-a-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability#comment-60870\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-1-is-a-critical-security-release-that-fixes-a-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability#comment-60870\">some users</a> have downgraded to WordPress 4.0 in order to fix plugin&#8217;s they rely on. Considering that 4.0.1 is a critical update filled with security and bug fixes, it&#8217;s <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you <strong>don&#8217;t downgrade to 4.0</strong>. Instead, use the plugin&#8217;s support forum and notify the developer of the issues you&#8217;re having.</p>\n<h2>But Point Releases Are Not Supposed to Break Anything</h2>\n<p>The biggest concern users have with auto updates is the fear something will break. By default, WordPress 3.7 and above is configured to automatically update WordPress for point releases which generally contain security and or bug fixes. These kind of updates normally don&#8217;t break anything but in this case, several of the plugins were already broken and the update exposed bad development practices used by plugin authors.</p>\n<p>All it takes is one bad experience during an auto update to lose trust in the system.

The new product is called <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/2014/11/19/hhvm-project-mercury/\" target=\"_blank\">Mercury</a> and it&#8217;s built to provide HHVM (with PHP-FPM failover) to customers who require better PHP performance.</p>\n<p>WP Engine is one of the first WordPress managed hosts to offer <a href=\"http://hhvm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HHVM</a> (HipHop Virtual Machine), a PHP execution engine originally <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/the-hiphop-virtual-machine/10150415177928920\" target=\"_blank\">created by Facebook</a> to help make its infrastructure more efficient. Since HHVM is still new and isn&#8217;t 100% stable in production environments, WP Engine has opted to provide automatic fallback to its default PHP stack. This failover protection is invisible to visitors and is only in use 0.1% of the time while HHVM restarts.</p>\n<p>WP Engine partnered with <a href=\"http://10up.com/\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a>, a WordPress development agency, to design and create a system to bring HHVM to customers. Benchmarks reported by 10up indicate staggering performance improvements of up to 600%.</p>\n<p>On a generic WordPress + bbPress installation with no page caching, HHVM delivers on average a 5.6 faster response time over multiple tests:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WPE-bbPress-hhvm.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34036]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WPE-bbPress-hhvm.jpg?resize=800%2C356\" alt=\"WPE Charts\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34084\" /></a></p>\n<p>When testing bbPress with 250 concurrent logged-in users, HHVM consistently delivers a 3.6x faster response time. A regular WordPress site with a custom theme and plugins resulted in approximately 3.9 times faster response time with HHVM as compared to PHP-FPM. At the moment, HHVM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tnpuig/status/535441283443994624\" target=\"_blank\">doesn&#8217;t play well with BuddyPress</a> but WP Engine plans to discuss this with John James Jacoby in the near future to see what can be done.</p>\n<p>10up founder Jake Goldman believes that HHVM will perform even better over time and become more affordable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mirroring the history of air travel, Mercury will invariably become smoother, more affordable, and more accessible with time. We’re already excited by the early results: bbPress response times up to 5.6x faster, 3.6x faster at just 740ms with 250 concurrent visitors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>10up volunteered its site as the first test case and is currently running on the new Mercury platform.</p>\n<p>Other developers have also been experimenting with WordPress on HHVM since earlier this year, achieving similar results in terms of performance improvement:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>Just got a dynamic WordPress page to load (no HTML output caching) and transfer to the browser in 58ms using HHVM.

Given how new and unstable it currently is, most hosts are not rushing to provide HHVM. However, the advances made by the collaboration between 10up and WP Engine should help to move other hosts along.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it is important to note that the Facebook HHVM open source team is really responsive to issues, thoughts, and feedback,&#8221; WP Engine representative Tomas Puig told the Tavern. &#8220;So it bodes super well for the future of us moving more WordPress systems to the technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Puig is optimistic that WP Engine and 10up&#8217;s work with HHVM will help to provide valuable feedback for WordPress core. &#8220;I deeply believe in Matt&#8217;s recent statements on WordPress as an application framework and the API work the core team is doing,&#8221; Puig said. &#8220;I think that HHVM enables us to build more rich experiences with WordPress in a more performant manner and that&#8217;s exciting. So really we want to elevate the community as a whole to getting our code ready for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mercury customers will be given a Vagrant configuration to use for local development, and Puig said that the company is wiling to provide the configuration to anyone who requests it.</p>\n<p>One challenge for developers using HHVM is knowing what plugins are compatible with it. &#8220;Something I&#8217;d love to see is an option to mark plugins and themes in the official repository as HHVM tested,&#8221; Puig said. WP Engine is starting to conduct a large round of basic testing to find out which popular plugins are compatible with HHVM. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be releasing that list to the community as a whole so people know where to look and are also working with plugin developers and theme shops to get their code ready,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>On the HHVM side, WP Engine has been instrumental in paving the way for other open source projects to take advantage of it. Paul Tarjan, Facebook&#8217;s head of Open Source for HHVM, highlighted the importance of this partnership in the Mercury announcement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WP Engine Labs team has done an impressive job in democratizing HHVM for the open-source community. We are excited to work alongside the Labs team to fine-tune the stack to reach HHVM’s full potential and drastically speed up PHP execution. PHP is the bedrock of Facebook, as well as much of the Internet, and this announcement should come as a major fillip for the entire developer community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The launch of Mercury means that many more WordPress users will have the opportunity to have their sites running on HHVM. As WordPress-specific issues are ironed out through WP Engine&#8217;s collaboration with the HHVM developers, it should become more stable over time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 22:00:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.0.1 is a Critical Security Release that Fixes a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=34049\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-1-is-a-critical-security-release-that-fixes-a-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2196:\"<p>WordPress core contributors released a security update today. All users who have not yet received the automatic update are encouraged to update as soon as possible. WordPress 4.0.1 is a critical security release that provides a fix for a critical cross-site scripting vulnerability, originally reported by <a href=\"http://klikki.fi/\" target=\"_blank\">Jouko Pynnonen</a> on September 26th.</p>\n<p>Sites running WordPress versions 3.9.2 and earlier are affected by the vulnerability.

This means that the vast majority of WordPress sites and in need of this critical update. A large number of those sites are also running versions that pre-date the automatic background updates that were introduced in WordPress 3.7.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wp-versions.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[34049]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wp-versions.jpg?resize=690%2C584\" alt=\"wp-versions\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34057\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to keep your site on the cutting edge of security updates, it&#8217;s critical to have automatic background updates enabled.

The company&#8217;s SSD-based cloud hosting products cater to developers and other tech-savvy customers.</p>\n<p>As of November, DigitalOcean counts a total 187,866 active users running a cloud server (or “Droplet”), thanks in large part to the company&#8217;s affordable pricing structure, which starts at $5/month.</p>\n<h4>How many DigitalOcean customers are running WordPress?</h4>\n<p>I spoke with Tyler Hoffman, a DigitalOcean representative, who reports that the the company hosts <strong>13,000 active 1-click WordPress droplets</strong>, a number which continues to grow each day. &#8220;These WordPress sites account for 3.74% of our total active &#8216;droplets,\'&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>These figures are based solely on users who have deployed DigitalOcean&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/one-click-install-wordpress-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-digitalocean\" target=\"_blank\">1-click WordPress images</a> and do not take into account any custom WordPress images. The total number of WordPress droplets is likely much higher. In fact, at the end of October, Netcraft <a href=\"http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/10/31/digitalocean-4th-largest-hosting-company-in-under-2-years.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that <strong>&#8220;more than 23% of the active sites hosted at DigitalOcean are running WordPress, compared with less than 10% of all other active sites around the world.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment, the company doesn&#8217;t seem to be actively trying to attract WordPress customers. Nevertheless, Hoffman reports that WordPress customers are on the rise. In October 2014, DigitalOcean users launched an average of 220 WordPress droplets per day via the 1-click method, roughly 6,600 per month. As WordPress currently powers <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" target=\"_blank\">more than 23% of the web</a>, it will be interesting to see how much of that market the company will be able to capture.</p>\n<p>Netcraft reports that DigitalOcean is currently netting more than 68,000 new customers per month. In general, developers seem to appreciate the speed of deployment, the simplicity of the hosting interface, and the API for managing droplets and resources.</p>\n<p>The company is still relatively new to the hosting industry and caters heavily to developers, which makes its rise to being the third largest provider all the more remarkable. Although DigitalOcean&#8217;s products don&#8217;t necessarily cater to the average non-developer WordPress user, the company seems to have no problem adding WordPress customers to its user base.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 00:23:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Dailybolt – It’s Like WordPress Planet For The Genesis Framework\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33930\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://wptavern.com/dailybolt-its-like-wordpress-planet-for-the-genesis-framework\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2346:\"<p>If you have trouble keeping up with everything that&#8217;s happening in the Genesis WordPress community, you might be interested in a new site created by Andrea Whitmer called <a title=\"http://dailybolt.com/\" href=\"http://dailybolt.com/\">The Dailybolt</a>. The Dailybolt publishes excerpts from sites that routinely write about the <a title=\"http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/\" href=\"http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/\">Genesis Framework</a> by <a title=\"http://www.studiopress.com/\" href=\"http://www.studiopress.com/\">StudioPress</a>.

I kept thinking it would be awesome to have a way to access the latest Genesis tutorials or articles without hunting them down on social media or in my RSS reader,&#8221; Whitmer said.</p>\n<p>I asked Whitmer if she plans to manually curate articles so the site contains more content dedicated to Genesis, &#8220;I created the site after polling my mailing list several months ago and they seemed interested in all the content coming from the community. So as of right now, I don’t plan to cull the other posts. However, I may remove some sites if they consistently publish articles about non-Genesis topics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can subscribe to the site via <a title=\"http://dailybolt.com/feed/\" href=\"http://dailybolt.com/feed/\">RSS</a> or email. Those who subscribe by email will receive a daily digest of headlines.

After three years of continual improvement, creator Tom McFarlin felt that the project had finally matured enough to warrant its own branding and website.</p>\n<p>As the boilerplate gained traction, McFarlin started receiving numerous requests for a generator to simplify the process of searching and replacing text strings throughout the boilerplate&#8217;s codebase. Although the boilerplate greatly speeds the process of structuring a new plugin to use a standardized, object-oriented foundation, it still requires the developer to manually replace strings for the plugin name, slug, URI and author info.</p>\n<p>Fans of the boilerplate have tried different approaches while attempting to come up with a generator, including one that uses a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-generator-for-the-wordpress-plugin-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">grunt-init template to generate a plugin from the boilerplate</a>. While this solution generates a plugin in about 30 seconds flat, grunt isn&#8217;t necessarily a part of every developer&#8217;s workflow.</p>\n<p>Today, McFarlin introduced a new generator option created by <a href=\"https://enriquechavez.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Enrique Chavez</a>, which provides the simplest approach to date. The <a href=\"http://wppb.me/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate Generator</a> is a web app that generates a plugin without you having to replace any text strings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wpb-generator.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33934]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wpb-generator.jpg?resize=902%2C638\" alt=\"wpb-generator\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33970\" /></a></p>\n<p>Simply enter your plugin information into the form on the site. When you click the &#8220;Build&#8221; button, the app will pull the code from the Boilerplate&#8217;s master branch on GitHub and will automatically replace all the necessary text strings. The result is your customized plugin delivered in a tidy zip file. If you use the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate as a starting point for your new plugins, this generator is a handy site to bookmark.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate</a> has now been starred more than 2,400 times on GitHub and has been forked more than 600 times. The project currently boasts 46 contributors and continues to grow. McFarlin plans to add more helpful resources to the boilerplate&#8217;s community site in early 2015 along with detailed documentation.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 20:02:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WPTavern: WP eCommerce Has a New Home\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33796\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://wptavern.com/wp-ecommerce-has-a-new-home\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6302:\"<p>In what has been a long time coming, WP eCommerce has changed the URL of its website from <a title=\"https://wpecommerce.org/\" href=\"https://wpecommerce.org/\">GetShopped.org</a> to <a title=\"https://wpecommerce.org/\" href=\"https://wpecommerce.org/\">WPEcommerce.org</a>.

It has a reputation among some developers in the WordPress community as being bloated and poorly coded. &#8220;The purpose of the rewrite is to bring us back up to latest WP coding standards,&#8221; Dan Milward, Founder of WP eCommerce, told the Tavern. &#8220;When we first released ​WP eCommerce, WordPress had sketchy coding standards at best (WordPress was at v1.5)​. As such, ​making a complex eCommerce Plugin back in the day was difficult and we had to do things in ways that are now frowned upon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To put this in perspective, custom post types, taxonomies, and many of the hooks and filters developers rely on today simply didn’t exist. The legacy code has plagued the project from the beginning and is largely responsible for its negative reputation.</p>\n<p>Not having a robust set of WordPress coding standards to develop from allowed other eCommerce plugins to enter the market and leap frog over WP eCommerce. &#8220;We feel like those days are behind us and that it&#8217;s our turn to do some leap frogging.&#8221; Milward said. The alignment with today&#8217;s coding standards means WP eCommerce has a smaller footprint, runs faster, and is easier to maintain.</p>\n<h2>A Team Effort</h2>\n<p>Gary Cao, who previously lead the development of WP eCommerce, helped pave the way towards aligning it with today&#8217;s <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/\">coding standards</a>. Justin Sainton, co-founder of WP eCommerce, has taken over the role and is leading the development of WP eCommerce. Sainton is a well known developer in the WordPress community and has an impressive array of core contributions to WordPress.</p>\n<p>Sainton and Milward approach problems from very different yet, complimentary angles. The relationship has helped create a better business allowing each to focus on their core strengths. The WP eCommerce support team has been instrumental in being the front line of the company. &#8220;These folks are the front line and they are turning public opinion around in the WordPress.org forums and in premium support​. They are doing a great job at serving the WP community,&#8221; Milward said.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PippinContributesToWPECommerce.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33796]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-33940\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PippinContributesToWPECommerce.png?resize=1002%2C440\" alt=\"Pippin Williamson of EDD With 45 Commits to WP eCommerce\" /></a>Pippin Williamson of EDD With 45 Commits to WP eCommerce\n<p>Contributions have come from non WP eCommerce core developers as well, including the competition. Pippin Williamson, founder of <a title=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, has <a title=\"https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce/commits?author=pippinsplugins\" href=\"https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce/commits?author=pippinsplugins\">45 commits</a> to the project since 2013. In early 2013, <a title=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/why-i-contribute-to-wpec/\" href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/why-i-contribute-to-wpec/\">Williamson explained</a> in detail why he contributes to WP eCommerce.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I empathize with projects attempting to overcome a bad reputation when they clearly want to <strong>earn</strong> a better reputation. If you write bad code and never actually try to improve your project then I have a hard time believing you actually care about your users’ experience. The team behind WP e-Commerce is NOT one of those teams that doesn’t care about improving their plugin. They are one of the most down to earth, caring team of developers I’ve met. They really, really care about their users and customers, and they truly want to make WPEC a kick ass plugin again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ben​ Huson​, Lee​ Willis​, Jeff​ Shutzman​,​ and Curtis McHale, <a title=\"https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce/graphs/contributors\" href=\"https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce/graphs/contributors\">among others</a> also contribute to the project.</p>\n<h2>The Future of WP eCommerce</h2>\n<p>With the launch of the new site complete, Milward says the next feature they&#8217;re working on is implementing a theme engine based on the work John James Jacoby put into bbPress and BuddyPress. New object-oriented APIs and integration with the upcoming WP-API are among some of the other features planned for a future release. There will also be improvements to the WP eCommerce marketplace ecosystem for developers.</p>\n<h2>Time to Give it Another Chance?</h2>\n<p>WP eCommerce is nine years old and continues to chip away at legacy code, but has made substantial improvements over the past two years. Perhaps it&#8217;s time developers and users give it another chance. WP eCommerce is free to use and <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/\">available</a> in the WordPress plugin directory.

This year also marks the first time non-English downloads of WordPress have surpassed its English counterpart.</p>\n<h2>Catering to Customer&#8217;s Needs</h2>\n<p>With WordPress raising the bar, it won&#8217;t be long until users and customers <strong>expect</strong> themes and plugins to be translatable and available in multiple languages. Rebecca Gill, of Web Savvy Marketing, <a title=\"http://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2014/11/wordpress-internationalization/\" href=\"http://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2014/11/wordpress-internationalization/\">announced</a> its catalog of themes are now translatable and coded for localization and multilingual use.</p>\n<p>In her post, Gill explains the thought process behind the move.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If 50% of our product sales are internationally based, then I need to spend time making sure these buyers are being taken care of and clearly I wasn’t. I was expecting this to be handled by Genesis, the WordPress core, or translation plugins.</p>\n<p>I didn’t realize how badly I was ignoring the needs of our international customer base. And for that, I am truly sorry.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The work was completed through a collaborated effort between Carrie Dils, Nir Rosenbaum, and Gary Jones. Each theme has been updated to include <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers\">I18n</a> and <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Right-to-Left_Language_Support\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Right-to-Left_Language_Support\">RTL</a> (Right to Left) support. Files included in each theme are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> POT File</strong> – A file with i18n ready strings.</li>\n<li><strong>en_US.po File</strong> – A file with translated strings and English strings.</li>\n<li><strong>en_US.mo File</strong> – A file converted to a format optimized to be read by machines.</li>\n<li><strong>RTL Style Sheet</strong> – Overwrites horizontal positioning attributes of your CSS stylesheet in a separate stylesheet file named rtl.css.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ever theme is an opportunity to learn techniques, code, and best-practices. I believe the quickest way to make an impact and to raise awareness is for commercial theme companies to support and advertise I18n and RTL as cool features.</p>\n<p>The fact these improvements are part of a smart business move doesn&#8217;t detract from their importance. The more theme developers and companies who place I18n and RTL near the top of the priority list, the better.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 23:02:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WPTavern: 20 Reasons To Attend a WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33784\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://wptavern.com/20-reasons-to-attend-a-wordcamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1832:\"<p>Ask twenty people why you should go to a WordCamp and you&#8217;ll likely receive 20 different answers.

Since email is usually the way most people find out about comments, having the ability to reply without leaving your inbox in convenient, especially when you&#8217;re on the go.</p>\n<p>Postmatic&#8217;s post and comment subscriptions feature is quite similar to <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack&#8217;s subscriptions module</a>. Jetpack is the plugin&#8217;s strongest competitor. While both plugins are free and perform similar functions, Postmatic includes the added ability to reply by email, subscription invitations, and a mobile-friendly email template that is fully customizable.</p>\n<p>Today, Postmatic&#8217;s co-founder Jason Lemieux <a href=\"http://gopostmatic.com/2014/11/beta6/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the plugin now supports single-click migration of subscribers from Jetpack. The beta 6 version of the plugin introduces a secure importer that will copy over all of your new post notification Jetpack subscribers in a matter of seconds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/postmatic-jetpack-import.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33854]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/postmatic-jetpack-import.png?resize=929%2C340\" alt=\"postmatic-jetpack-import\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33876\" /></a></p>\n<p>Beta 6 adds a native Postmatic exporter to allow users to export their subscribers, along with subscription preferences, to a CSV file. Postmatic&#8217;s creators are also gradually adding to a <a href=\"http://gopostmatic.com/faq/postmatic-render-shortcodes/\" target=\"_blank\">shortcode whitelist</a> that will allow the display of third-party shortcode content in emails.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> is available on WordPress.org and is production ready but is still in limited-release beta. Postmatic is releasing a few hundred API keys per week to those who <a href=\"http://gopostmatic.com/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for beta access</a>.</p>\n<p>In the future, the Postmatic creators hope to monetize the plugin by offering paid delivery of outgoing mail for larger sites, Lemieux told Post Status in a recent <a href=\"http://www.poststat.us/postmatic-wordpress-email/\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a>. They also have an extensive list of planned features. The basic Postmatic plugin, however, will remain free for any number of blogs with any number of posts and subscribers.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 20:08:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Gigaom’s Blazing Fast WordPress Search is Enhanced by Sphinx and Scriblio\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=33789\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://wptavern.com/gigaoms-blazing-fast-wordpress-search-is-enhanced-by-sphinx-and-scriblio\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5021:\"<p><a href=\"https://gigaom.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gigaom</a> has been pumping out a steady stream of news and analysis on technology since 2006. The WordPress-powered site attracts 6.5 million monthly unique visitors with topics ranging from science and energy to cloud businesses, media and mobile.</p>\n<p>With years of articles buried in its archives, it&#8217;s important for Gigaom to have a solid search experience. The site&#8217;s engineering team, led by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/misterbisson/\" target=\"_blank\">Casey Bisson</a>, opted to utilize Sphinx in order to improve upon WordPress&#8217; native searching capabilities.</p>\n<p>The result is a super fast dedicated search page at <a href=\"http://search.gigaom.com/\" title=\"Gigaom Search\" target=\"_blank\">search.gigaom.com</a> that features the ability to further narrow results based on available terms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gigaom-search.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33789]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gigaom-search.png?resize=1025%2C1023\" alt=\"gigaom-search\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33809\" /></a></p>\n<p>The advanced search feature was built using a combination of several open source plugins built by Bisson. These plugins integrate Sphinx and taxonomy filtering to help users more easily explore Gigaom&#8217;s wealth of content. All the tools are open source and were contributed back to the community for anyone to use.</p>\n<h4>What is Sphinx?</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://sphinxsearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sphinx</a> is a GPL-licensed full text search server that was created to be highly performant while returning the most relevant results. In order to integrate it with WordPress, Bisson developed <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/go-sphinx/\" target=\"_blank\">Gigaom Sphinx</a>. The plugin pulls WordPress posts into Sphinx and then queries them using the standard <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/\" target=\"_blank\">WP_Query</a> class.</p>\n<p>Gigaom Sphinx requires that you first <a href=\"http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current/installation.html\" target=\"_blank\">install Sphinx</a> and then set it up with the sample config file, which includes parameters to index the site&#8217;s content. Once the site is fully indexed in Sphinx, WordPress query performance will be greatly improved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sphinx-config.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33789]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sphinx-config.png?resize=700%2C531\" alt=\"sphinx-config\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33825\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Scriblio</h4>\n<p>In order to further filter results, Gigaom uses <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/scriblio/\" title=\"Scriblio plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Scriblio</a>, a plugin that provides faceted searching and browsing of WordPress posts, pages, and custom post types. This enables users to further narrow down results based on taxonomies and their available terms. The facets are easily added via configurable widgets, which you can include on your site&#8217;s search, tag and category archives, and other archive pages.</p>\n<p>Search results can be filtered using multiple terms. This allows visitors to quickly nail down the most relevant content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/example-search.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33789]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/example-search.png?resize=1025%2C821\" alt=\"example-search\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33833\" /></a></p>\n<p>The facets can be displayed as either tag clouds or lists, as shown above. Scriblio&#8217;s search editor widget will show the selected search terms and allows the user to easily add or remove terms while automatically updating results.</p>\n<p>The plugin also includes live search suggestions as you type. These recommendations are based on all available taxonomies as well as post titles.</p>\n<h4>bCMS</h4>\n<p>The last plugin required to create Gigaom&#8217;s unique search experience is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bcms/\" target=\"_blank\">bCMS</a>, which was also developed by Bisson.

Instead, Composer has been delayed and the release date is <em>to be determined</em>. According to the <a title=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/learn-through-doing/launching-composer-tomorrow/\" href=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/learn-through-doing/launching-composer-tomorrow/\">announcement</a>, the plugin and its architecture are not ready for customers just yet. In a FAQ accompanying the post, SIDEKICK Co-founder, Ben Fox, gives more details on what&#8217;s not ready.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A little bit of everything really. The new architecture which is going to power SIDEKICK Composer and the new version of our Player is kick-ass and working but the integration between it, the new account centre, the billing system and Composer itself is still “fragile”.  Add to that the fact that the new version of our website, which is necessary to power the front-end of the new Account Center, isn’t complete yet and we have a recipe for launch disaster.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although it is disappointing to those who expected to purchase Composer over the weekend, at least one person cites the news as a good example of what to do when you&#8217;re not ready to launch a product.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>This is what you do when your software isn’t quite ready to go by launch date: <a href=\"http://t.co/pEkKNbPvUw\">http://t.co/pEkKNbPvUw</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Aaron Hockley (@ahockley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ahockley/status/533427677831901184\">November 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since the news broke, SIDEKICK has received an unexpected outpouring of support. &#8220;Something like 30 direct emails, numerous tweets and FaceBook messages plus we were approached at WordCamp Toronto by many people who offered their support for our choice,&#8221; Fox told the Tavern. Several people have commended SIDEKICK for its transparency. &#8220;What really got me though was not just the understanding our customers and community have shown but also the praise for our direct and transparent communication.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Finding The Balance Between Good Enough and Don&#8217;t Ship</h2>\n<p>Despite a lot of talk in the WordPress community around the idea of &#8220;<a title=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/10/28/keynote-speaker-cory-miller-what-it-means-to-click-publish/\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/10/28/keynote-speaker-cory-miller-what-it-means-to-click-publish/\">just ship it</a>&#8220;, SIDEKICK decided to hold off to fix a few loose ends. In an essay by Matt Mullenweg entitled &#8220;<a title=\"http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/\">1.0 Is The Loneliest Number</a>,&#8221; he uses Apple as an example of a company that&#8217;s not afraid to ship a rudimentary version 1.0 to the public. The essay goes on to describe the idea of <em>ship early, iterate often</em> and how it&#8217;s the approach used to develop WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By shipping early and often you have the unique competitive advantage of hearing from real people what they think of your work, which in best case helps you anticipate market direction, and in worst case gives you a few people rooting for you that you can email when your team pivots to a new idea. Nothing can recreate the crucible of real usage.</p>\n<p>You think your business is different, that you’re only going to have one shot at press and everything needs to be perfect for when Techcrunch brings the world to your door. But if you only have one shot at getting an audience, you’re doing it wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The challenge of releasing the first version of a product or service is one many companies are familiar with. Composer is not ready for prime time but the question is, how will Fox and his team determine when it&#8217;s ready? &#8220;SIDEKICK will never be perfect in our eyes and we waited until the last possible moment to make the call because we wanted to make sure we weren&#8217;t releasing simply out of a need for perfection,&#8221; Fox told the Tavern. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for the entire community or other startups but I can tell you that while we&#8217;re not afraid to release a product that&#8217;s not &#8216;perfect&#8217;, we will never release something that doesn&#8217;t work as advertised just for the sake of making a release date.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Where is The Happy Medium?</h2>\n<p>When it comes to releasing a product, there appears to be a happy medium of being good enough for consumer adoption but not bad enough to delay the release. As a product developer or service provider, how do you determine when your product or service has reached the happy medium and what factors go into the decision? Let us know in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 00:09:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Matt: Peak Beard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://ma.tt/2014/11/peak-beard/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:537:\"<p>&#8220;If, like me, you are a staunch pogonophile and do not believe there is a single man who cannot be improved with a beard, these are happy times indeed.&#8221; The Guardian asks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jul/24/have-we-reached-peak-beard\">Have we reached peak beard?</a>.

The company recently acquired $120 million to fund further growth and is now valued at $1.1 billion dollars.</p>\n<p>While Slack helps teams get things done together, much of the actual work happens outside of the app. That&#8217;s why the <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack API</a> offers the ability to add new <a href=\"https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook\" target=\"_blank\">Incoming WebHooks</a> to integrate outside services. With WordPress powering 23%+ of the world&#8217;s websites, it&#8217;s important to have an easy way to bring in notices from those sites.</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress installations have the option of using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/slack/\" target=\"_blank\">Slack plugin</a>, created by <a href=\"http://gedex.web.id/\" target=\"_blank\">Akeda Bagus</a>, a developer with X-team. Last week we featured the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/bbpress-slack-integration-send-new-topics-and-replies-to-a-slack-channel\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress Slack Integration</a> plugin, which allows you to send notifications of new bbPress topics and replies to your Slack channel of choice. WP Slack performs a similar function for general WordPress events.</p>\n<p>The plugin is capable of notifying Slack, based on a few basic events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a post needs review (status transitioned to &#8216;pending&#8217;)</li>\n<li>When a post is published</li>\n<li>When there&#8217;s a new comment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, it includes a <code>slack_get_events</code> filter for adding more events. The <a href=\"http://gedex.web.id/wp-slack/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> provides an example of creating a new event that will notify Slack when a user is logged in:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">add_filter( \'slack_get_events\', function( $events ) {\n    $events[\'user_login\'] = array(\n        \'action\'      =&gt; \'wp_login\',\n        \'description\' =&gt; __( \'When user logged in\', \'slack\' ),\n        \'message\'     =&gt; function( $user_login ) {\n            return sprintf( \'%s is logged in\', $user_login );\n        }\n    );\n\n    return $events;\n} );</pre>\n<p>Configuration inside the WordPress admin is simple. Once you&#8217;ve set up the webhook with Slack, you simply paste it into the Service URL field when setting up an integration:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slack-integration.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33712]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/slack-integration.png?resize=843%2C524\" alt=\"slack-integration\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33756\" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Slack allows you to set up multiple integrations so you can send notices to different channels. Notices can also be temporarily deactivated and turned back on a later time. When you finish setting up an integration, the plugin allows you to fire off a test notification to ensure that it&#8217;s working correctly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/channel-notification.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[33712]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/channel-notification.png?resize=843%2C227\" alt=\"channel-notification\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-33758\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bagus has also developed a suite of free extensions that notify Slack based on events triggered by other plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-edd\" target=\"_blank\">Slack EDD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\">Slack WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-contact-form-7\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Contact Form 7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/slack-gravityforms\" target=\"_blank\">Slack Gravity Forms</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These plugins make it possible to keep your team notified of new orders on a WooCommerce or EDD-powered store, or even website inquiries from your site&#8217;s contact form. Each extension requires the Slack plugin to be installed first.</p>\n<p>While the plugin author hasn&#8217;t announced plans to add this feature, it might be useful to have support for <a href=\"https://my.slack.com/services/new/outgoing-webhook\" target=\"_blank\">Outgoing Webhooks</a> as well. That would make it possible for WordPress to get information back from Slack based on public triggers used in the channel. The possibilities for this could be interesting. For example, you could set up a trigger that automatically creates a new draft or perhaps publishes a one-sentence summary of a quick meeting.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/slack/\" title=\"WordPress Slack plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Slack plugin for WordPress</a> is available in the official Plugin Directory.

As a result, now more than 90% of all our WordPress sites are on PHP 5.5 or higher. As scary as such a massive update may sound when you have more than 100,000 WordPress instances, it turned out to be a real success.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7260\"></span></p>\n<h3>But PHP 5.5 was available for our customers for more than an year…</h3>\n<p>We are one of the few hosting companies that always make the latest PHP version available for use to all its customers as soon as it has a stable release. But we also have a philosophy that it is the customer’s own choice which PHP version will be used on each of its folders. Providing this unique flexibility we thought we have done our due. </p>\n<p>However, lately we have been hearing more and more talks in the WordPress community about the negatives of using the old PHP versions and especially PHP 5.2. That got us auditing the versions of the WordPress and PHP used on our servers. Although, the percentage of sites using PHP 5.2 was really low, we found the number of sites not using the current most widely adopted PHP version – 5.5, to be surprisingly high for our standards.</p>\n<p>We got curious what are the reasons for so many people not to use more recent PHP versions, when we have provided them with the option to easily do that.</p>\n<h3>… so why did clients use old PHP versions in general?</h3>\n<p>When researching the reasons why, it turns out the greater majority of the clients were either unaware of the existence of a more recent one or felt uncomfortable updating on their own and thought they need a developer to do it. As it is our mission to both keep our clients safe (by keeping their software up-to-date), and make their life easier when it comes to website maintenance, we decided to help them make the change. By stepping in we also took over any additional maintenance work related to the update. Clients were given the option to opt out if they thought this update might have bad consequences for their sites.</p>\n<h3>We took the responsibility to do the move</h3>\n<p>So basically our conclusion was that giving the choice to the customers may not be enough. Taking the responsibility to make the right choice for them and being there to deal with any possible consequences turned out to be a better approach. We updated the PHP version of thousands of installations. We got a handful of tickets asking for assistance after the update, which were all related to a client using a specific plugin incompatible with the PHP 5.5 version. Such cases were either fixed, where possible, or downgraded to the old version upon client’s discretion.</p>\n<p>So the conclusion of this campaign is that we will still stay true to our philosophy to value the customer freedom of choice. However, we will not let this philosophy prevent us from taking the responsibility and helping the customer make the right choice, whenever possible. </p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/Agpv7RHs1aw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordpress-sites-on-php-5-5/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordpress-sites-on-php-5-5/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"The CryptoPHP Infection – A Story About Getting Paid Themes and Plugins for Free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/IHY8K6kbJ4I/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://blog.siteground.com/cryptophp-infection/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 07:34:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WordPress, Joomla, etc.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7245\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"A few of our email servers went wild sending spam this weekend.

After quickly fixing the spam issue, we started the longer process of identifying the cause for the spam. It turned out to be the CryptoPHP infection (check out the <a href=\"https://foxitsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/cryptophp-whitepaper-foxsrt-v4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">official whitepaper</a>), activated through a few WordPress themes and plugins.<br />\n<span id=\"more-7245\"></span></p>\n<h3>What is CryptoPHP infection?</h3>\n<p>The CryptoPHP infection was detected a long time ago, but seems to have been more frequently exploited over the last few months. Hackers who use that method to exploit websites, take paid WordPress, Joomla and Drupal themes and extensions, remove the code blocks that verify a certain extension/theme is licensed, and then distribute them for free. Such versions of extensions/themes are called nulled scripts.</p>\n<p>The modified themes/extensions usually contain malicious code that provides full access to the infected sites to the hacker. Inside a nulled theme/extension there is a line of code that looks similar to this:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;?php include(\'assets/images/social.png\'); ?&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Most PHP developers will immediately notice that this code block looks strange. The PHP directive includes a file, which should contain PHP code. However, in this case the file is an image and it contains malicious code, which is usually obfuscated. The malicious code is used for various purposes like black-hat SEO attacks and other, such as on our servers, sending spam.</p>\n<h3>What we did?</h3>\n<p>First, we scanned our servers to identify how many sites were infected and we limited the access to the nulled scripts. This means that such malicious files will not run as expected on our servers and hackers will not be able to use them to access sites hosted on our infrastructure.<br />\nSecond, we are in the process of applying a server-wide protection to make sure any future attempts like the CryptoPHP infection are prevented.</p>\n<h3>What You should do?</h3>\n<p>As we cannot establish the full scope of the damages that the infection might have incurred, we sent an email to all infected users asking them to do two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the list of users to their applications for admins they do not recognize and delete them. The admin user has full access to your site and if that user is not created by you for a trusted person, it is most probably created by the hacker.</li>\n<li>Run an audit of your websites for possible backdoors left by the hackers, which means &#8211; look for unknown files that are not supposed to be on your account.<br />\nWe also strongly recommend you never to download free extensions and themes that are supposed to be paid. No matter what type of software you download, make sure you do it from a reputable source.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also encourage you to share the information about this vulnerability and why using free themes that are supposed to be paid is not a good idea. This will help create awareness and protect more websites from the infection.</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/IHY8K6kbJ4I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://blog.siteground.com/cryptophp-infection/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://blog.siteground.com/cryptophp-infection/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"jHackGuard Received a Major Update!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/u540aHeB4_k/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://blog.siteground.com/jhackguard-major-update/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Nov 2014 06:00:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Hosting service news\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WordPress, Joomla, etc.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7197\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:353:\"Since we initially released jHackGuard back in 2010, it has been shipped with all the Joomlas installed on SiteGround servers and has additionally been downloaded more than 86,000 times from our download pages.

Since it&#8217;s now a pack of a component and plugin, we&#8217;re not limited to the options page for plugins. </p>\n<p>In addition to that, you can now see all the logged activity right in the component instead of having to browse through log files manually. </p>\n<p>We have also added <a href=\"http://botscout.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BotScout</a> support to the plugin. This is a free database of spam bots that&#8217;s been maintained regularly. When enabled, this functionality will use that database to prevent spam bots from submitting any data on your site.</p>\n<p>The next functionality we&#8217;ve added is the integrated firewall that allows you to blacklist and whitelist IP addresses and networks. This basically gives you the ability to protect your site from DoS and Brute Force attacks from certain IPs and at the same time to make sure that your own address will always have access to your site.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the patterns and rules that we use to protect you from being hacked are now located on a separate server and not hard-coded within the what used to be a plugin itself. This will allow us to update the firewall rules much more often and act immediately when new vulnerabilities emerge. In the past, we had to release an update of the plugin in order to add new checks and now we can do this instantly.</p>\n<h3>How to Update?</h3>\n<p>Updating to the next version of jHackGuard is really, really easy. Simply download it from our <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/joomla-hosting/joomla-extensions/ver1.5/jhack.htm\" target=\"_blank\">jHackGuard page</a>  and install it on top of the old plugin. For more information on that matter, please check our tutorial on <a href=\"http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/joomla/install-joomla-extension.htm\" target=\"_blank\">how to install Joomla extensions</a>. The installer will automatically remove the old plugin and replace it with the new component + plugin package.</p>\n<p>The new update is available only for Joomla 3. If you are still using Joomla 1.5 and 2.5 you should continue to use the old versions of our plugin compatible with your Joomla version.</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/u540aHeB4_k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://blog.siteground.com/jhackguard-major-update/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://blog.siteground.com/jhackguard-major-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WP eCommerce Plugin Vulnerability Fixed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/prk79_ibBls/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wp-ecommerce-vulnerability/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 13:09:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7204\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:388:\"Yesterday Sucuri reported a new vulnerability in WP eCommerce &#8211; a popular WordPress plugin for online stores.

As you know we carefully choose our hardware, we do a lot of customizations on the server software and we have added Varnish and Memcached support within our SuperCacher plugin. All this is done to provide you the fastest possible environment. However, the speed of your site depends not only on the environment it’s hosted on but on the way it’s built and handled by browsers too. This is why we’re happy to announce our partnership with the creators of the WP Rocket plugin for WordPress which can further optimize the speed of your WordPress by improving the way it is opened by the browsers.<br />\n<span id=\"more-7169\"></span></p>\n<h3>How WP Rocket Helps your Site Become Faster?</h3>\n<p>The plugin provides you with few ways to improve the speed of your site but its strongest part and what grabbed my attention immediately is the way it handles JS and CSS minifications. This functionality is not new, and there are many plugins that try to optimize you JS and CSS code for faster loading times. However, it can be a tricky business and if not done right, it can actually break your site and prevent it from loading properly. I have tested WP Rocket minification on a site with a pretty messed up CSS, which I have been able to break with almost any other similar WordPress plugin. It felt great that the WP Rocket was able to handle this complex case without any problems. On top of that, the minified CSS &#038; JS files are cached which further reduces the loading time of your pages.</p>\n<p>The next optimization provided by WP Rocket is called Lazy Image Loading. Basically, upon the initial load, your page will render only the images that are visible to the visitor. If you have a lot of images on your page, they will be loaded by a JavaScript when you scroll down towards the end of the page. The best example for this technique is Facebook and the way it shows more and more posts while you scroll down.</p>\n<p>Finally, WP Rocket provides an option to enable page caching for your WordPress site. If you enable this feature, the final result of your pages will be saved into static files and then served to your visitors. Note, however, that if you are using the Dynamic cache option of the SiteGround SuperCacher on your website, you don’t need to enable this particular option because the SuperCacher operates on server level, stores its data into the RAM and results in much faster loading time for your pages.</p>\n<h3>What is the Partnership About?</h3>\n<p>To begin with, the WP Rocket developers have tested their plugin on our servers extensivly making sure that everything is working perfectly. Furthermore, they have added SuperCacher support to the plugin. This means that when you delete your WP Rocket cache, it will automatically purge our dynamic cache too.</p>\n<p>Next, we have a special promotion valid for SiteGround customers. Click on the banner in the <a href=\"https://ua.siteground.com/resources.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Resources page</a> in your Customer Area and you will get the exclusive 20% off discount for purchasing WP Rocket!</p>\n<p>Both our teams are really passionate about site speed and performance optimization.

That is why security solutions and protocols evolve all the time and developers frequently release new versions. The two cryptographic protocols that provide communication security over the Internet are TLS and SSL. The latest version of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL version 3.0) is the predecessor of TLS and is nearly 15 years old. So it was only a matter of time for someone to find the next big issue related to the SSL protocol. Yesterday Bodo Möller from the Google Security Team wrote <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a> about a new vulnerability in the design of SSL version 3.0. The vulnerability allows attackers to calculate the plain text of secure connections.<br />\n<span id=\"more-7162\"></span></p>\n<h3>Possible Fixes:</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to protect yourself. The first and best way to mitigate this problem is to completely disable SSL version 3.0 on all of your servers and also remove SSL 3.0 support from all client products. For example, Google officially announced in the same blog post that in the coming months they will remove SSL version 3.0 support from all of their client products (including the Google Chrome browser). Cloudflare and Sucuri already stopped supporting it. All other major browsers will also disable SSLv3 by default (Firefox version 34 will be released on Nov 25).</p>\n<p>The second solution is to support <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00\" target=\"_blank\">TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV</a>. This is a solution which prevents attackers from tricking browsers to use the old SSLv3 protocol instead of the TLS protocol. However, this solution is difficult to implement (many people will need to manually compile custom version of openssl) and it is only a new patch which solves this issue but does not provide any guarantees that SSLv3 won’t become vulnerable again a week from now.</p>\n<h3>Our Solution:</h3>\n<p>Based on a detailed analysis of our network and the traffic towards our servers we decided to completely remove SSL version 3.0 support. As a matter of fact, a big portion of our servers have already been configured to support only the TLS encryption protocol and we’re in the process of reconfiguring all machines that are part of our infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>Possible Issues:</h3>\n<p>We know that some web applications still use SSLv3. Let’s say that for example a developer has decided to configure his/her PHP app to use SSLv3 via the CURLOPT_SSLVERSION option. Unfortunately, if such application connects to our servers, the connection will not be established and the developer will need to patch the code of the app. Our analysis shows that less than 0.05% of all traffic towards our servers is SSLv3. Thus, we do not expect such issues to occur, but we still encourage our customers to contact us via our Helpdesk if they notice any SSL-related issues.</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/7Za1mm-Leac\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"http://blog.siteground.com/goodbye-ssl-version-3/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://blog.siteground.com/goodbye-ssl-version-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WordCamp Europe – First Time Organizer Perspective\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/bHtNoCZhEcE/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordcamp-europe-2014-organizer-perspective/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Oct 2014 12:34:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Sponsorships and events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WordPress, Joomla, etc.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7152\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:311:\"For the last few months there have been times that I wasn&#8217;t present at the office, I could not attend some of the weekly SiteGround meetings and I have neglected a lot of the internal mail communication, that needed my attention.

But it was all for a great reason &#8212; I was lucky and honored to be part of the core organizing team of what turned out to be one of the most successful WordCamps. With 2 conference days, a packed Contributors Day and almost 800 people in attendance, I dare to say that <a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe</a> was one of the best and most rewarding experiences I’ve ever been part of.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-7152\"></span></p>\n<h3>How Did All This Happen in the First Place?</h3>\n<p>Up until #WCEU my WordCamps involvement consisted of representing SiteGround on many of the events we sponsor and communicating with the organizers about all sponsorship related things. It just happened naturally that during the last 2 years I also got involved with our local community (which is absolutely awesome btw!) by helping organize WordCamp Sofia and the Local WordPress 10th anniversary celebration, which SiteGround supported as well.</p>\n<p>So when a call for WordCamp Europe organizers was put up and after the amazing WordCamp Sofia we had the previous year, SiteGround encouraged me to join the rest of the WordCamp Sofia organizers and to be part of the team that will apply to organize the event here. The rest is history as they say. Once we knew that Sofia was chosen to host WordCamp Europe, SiteGround decided to dedicate part of my work time to organizing the event and I am so glad they did.</p>\n<p>Now that the dust has settled, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the event and share some insights about the challenges I faced and lessons I learned as an organizer.</p>\n<h3>1. Volunteer Work ≠ Little Work ⇒ Dedicate Time if you Want to do it Right.</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is 100% volunteer organized and also incredibly time consuming. If SiteGround hadn’t decided that part of my work time will be dedicated to this event, I would not have been able to do even 1/10 of what I actually did and I would have never been as involved with WCEU. So my advice to future WordCamp organizers would be: if you are a freelancer or self employed, accept the fact that you will be spending a lot of your time on the event and your normal routine and projects will probably fall behind. If you are employed, you’d better convince your boss that it’s well worth it to dedicate part of your work time to work on the event. I am lucky enough that SiteGround didn’t need any convincing on that part, on the contrary &#8211; as firm believers in contributing to WordPress, they encouraged me and here’s the time to say a huge thanks for not only allowing me but also helping me with the organization of this amazing event.</p>\n<h3>2. Don’t be Afraid to Step up and Take Responsibility. Be Proactive.</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Europe was organized by a team of 15 people. 10 of the organizers were located all over Europe part of which participated in last year’s WCEU organization, and 5 of us were first time WCEU organizers and were here in Sofia. Working mainly at SiteGroud for the last 8+ years, I am used to act in an environment where roles are clear, communication is mostly face to face, tasks are distributed quite quickly and job’s being done pretty fast. Probably this explains my initial frustration during the first weeks after I started working as part of the WCEU organization team, where all the communication was only online through Skype and P2, there seemed to be lack of clear structure, immediate todos and material results. I was the new kid on the block and wasn’t sure what was the best approach to this situation. This was a crucial moment when I could have easily become discouraged and disconnected, but instead I decided to take the initiative in my hands instead of passively waiting for someone to assign tasks to me. After all I was the one with the best idea what I am good at, so I stepped up, assigned myself the tasks I was OK with and started working on them.</p>\n<p>The rest was a question of good communication to the other team members and lots of enthusiasm to get things done.</p>\n<h3>3. Communicate &#8211; Be as Precise, Clear, Justified and Timely as Possible</h3>\n<p>With a team this big and distributed, it’s needless to say that communication is the key to get the job done. Everyone on the team needs to be up to date with the progress of your work and should be able to provide feedback. For example, as a person on the ground taking care of the venue and food, I made sure I posted detailed pictures of the venue with suggested layouts, decoration, and signage. I also described my catering research process and the requirements I had for the food. Also, whenever I had an idea or suggestion, I made sure to explain it as good as possible and justify it. I should admit that sometimes when being short on time and deprived of sleep I was tempted to just inform briefly the others about a decision I have already made and avoid discussion. However, resisting this temptation and actually being willing to hear what the others have to say has always led to great results.</p>\n<p>Outgoing communication to speakers, sponsors and volunteers is as important as your internal team communication. Those people are going to set the vibe for the event and it’s only going to be positive if they’ve been treated well by the organizers. One thing we could have done better this year is precisely communication to speakers &#8211; we delayed our responses to the people who applied to speak and we know that this made travels planning for some of them a bit hectic.</p>\n<h3>4. Start with the Budget &#8211; It’s the First Step to a Great Event</h3>\n<p>When I started working on the budget for WordCamp Europe, I had no idea that it will require so much time. However, after I was through with the task, I was thankful for every minute spent on it. If there’s one thing to recommend to future WordCamp organizers it is: take the time to do your budget right.</p>\n<p>Detailed and proper planning of our budget gave us 3 immediate benefits: 1) We had done the big part of the research process on the vendors we would later work with for food, t-shirts, coffee breaks, printing, etc and this made our work afterwards much easier. 2) We knew exactly how much money we needed to raise from sponsors and got our sponsorship packages ready. 3) We were able to set an affordable price for our event and attract as many people as possible. WordCamp Europe ticket price was only 30 Euro which is one of the least expensive WordCamp tickets so far.</p>\n<h3>5. Enjoy it!</h3>\n<p>I failed miserably at this one several times mostly because I am diagnosed with perfectionism and lack of patience, but the sooner you accept that some things will happen slow and over others you do not have full control, the better. I am incredibly thankful to absolutely everyone from our organizing team for the patience and the support in the difficult moments (I need to mention especially <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/petyeah\">Petya</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/dzver\">Veselin</a> as they have seen the worst of me) and trusting me to be part of the most epic WordCamp to date. No matter how stressful and busy it was at times, <a href=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t31.0-8/10572079_452563684884178_2161061276727603421_o.jpg\">this</a> was well worth it and I am glad and thankful that I did it.</p>\n<p>P.S.

A shell is a program that takes your commands (accessing folders, listing files, etc.) that you type and sends them to the operating system to be executed. The Bash vulnerability, also known as Shellshock, allows attackers to issue arbitrary commands via crafted environment variables.<br />\n<span id=\"more-7119\"></span></p>\n<p>The bad thing about this specific vulnerability is that it is fairly easy to craft such a request and attack a server. In addition, the vulnerability affects all types of devices and not only web servers &#8211; routers, some mobile devices, Linux computers and even Mac OS X devices are also affected. There is a simple test that will show you if you’re vulnerable. Just run the following command within your shell:</p>\n<p><code style=\"padding: 2px; background: #eaeaea;\">env X=\"() { :;} ; echo BUSTED\" /bin/sh -c \"echo test\"</code></p>\n<p>If you see the word “BUSTED” echoed back then your Bash version is vulnerable and you have to update.</p>\n<p>Now that you’re scared it’s time for the good news. All SiteGround servers were patched in less than 24 hours the vulnerability was announced. In addition, our unique server setup including the special chroot isolation has made it highly unlikely for any attacker to have been able to utilize this vulnerability and gain access to sensitive information even before the patch.</p>\n<p>If you have an account on our servers you don’t need to do anything because we’ve got you covered. However, please remember that this vulnerability also affects other devices and not only web servers. If you’re using Linux as your operating system you need to update Bash to the latest available stable version just to make sure that you’re not at risk.</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/U4ecx8fDC10\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"http://blog.siteground.com/major-bash-vulnerability-fixed-on-all-servers/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://blog.siteground.com/major-bash-vulnerability-fixed-on-all-servers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Updated: WordCamp Europe Coming to Sofia!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/wbhqlVDXg8M/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordcamp-europe-2014/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 13:31:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Sponsorships and events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7087\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:316:\"At SiteGround we definitely love WordCamps.

We spent three extremely exciting and rewarding days together with more than 300 other WordPress enthusiasts in the City of Angels. We also had the chance to be involved in many of the great #WCLAX activities including the beginner’s workshop, the selfie scavenger hunt and the contribution Sunday.<br />\n<span id=\"more-7074\"></span></p>\n<h3>The Beginner’s Workshop</h3>\n<p>We started out the conference on Friday, September 5th, with the beginners workshop track where attendees were encouraged to make their first steps with WordPress. Everything from setting up a website, choosing a theme and adding content was explained and exercised under the guidance of seasoned speakers such as Gregg Franklin, Adam Silver and our own Philip Artinyan. Phil gave out a talk on how to choose your domain and hosting services – a comprehensive guide on the important things to look for when choosing a company to work with. As part of the SiteGround customer care team, both me and Philip have helped online many people get started with their first projects but doing it face-to-face on the spot was even more exciting.</p>\n<h3>The Great Crowd</h3>\n<p>We spent the majority of the second day of the event on the SiteGround sponsor booth. No words can express the sheer joy of meeting your customers face-to-face and getting positive feedback. We exchanged words and emotions, introduced ourselves to the rest of the crowd and found lots of new friends among the WP enthusiasts. A special thank you goes to all of the organizers for doing such a great job with the event and for organizing together with us the Selfie Scavenger Hunt. During the whole day you could see people taking pictures with speakers, volunteers, newbies and the SiteGround team. The game helped attendees seek out contacts, network and share the fun with each other. Later at the after party we gave out few cool prizes (iPad Air, 2 iPad minis and some professional headphones) to the most diligent selfie hunters. We also had the chance to talk to many more people in a great informal environment and discuss WordPress, social media and how people that come together to share their experience can actually influence and change products and services for the better.</p>\n<h3>The Contribution Day</h3>\n<p>On the last day of the event many people gathered at the Blankspaces DTLA to contribute to the WordPress project. This was my first contribution day and I was surprised to find out how easy it is to give back to the community – all you need is a genuine wish to get involved. The contribution day was extremely well-organized, with dedicated people that were helping all the volunteers get started. A great calm co-working environment formed naturally and made everyone involved feel really good about doing it.</p>\n<p>WordCamp L.A. turned out to be everything I hoped for. A place that gathered passionate and positive people which eagerly shared their knowledge and skills. We came back home with new ideas, a lot of new friends and fully charged for the next WordCamp event!</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/RAxlwHadOu4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordcamp-la-2014-recap/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordcamp-la-2014-recap/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Stoked by Reasons To Be Creative\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/SCh0v2hlRr8/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"http://blog.siteground.com/stoked-by-reasons-to-be-creative/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 10:32:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Sponsorships and events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:377:\"I spent last week in Brighton (UK), attending the Reasons To Be Creative conference, which SiteGround sponsored.

Right from the beginning of the event I started hearing the word “stoked” (completely and intensely enthusiastic, exhilarated, or excited about something, according to the Urban Dictionary) unusually often. I heard it repeatedly used not only by John Davey (the great guy organizing the event), but also by many of the attendees. By the end of the event I already knew how it felt like to be stoked myself.<br />\n<span id=\"more-7047\"></span></p>\n<p>Reasons To Be Creative is one of those rare opportunities to get truly inspired, that you just can’t miss, especially if you are working in the digital creativity space, and even if you are just a business-oriented person with no previous experience with Photoshop or any other Adobe product (as I am). Allowing yourself to be challenged, provoked and inspired is a key ingredient of life and we should be looking for opportunities to get that. Events like this tempt you to want more for yourself, to get better in what you do, and most of all, to unleash your creativity.</p>\n<h3>Creativity is a result of a hard work</h3>\n<p>You thought that creativity is a gift and comes easily to few chosen people only? Well there were many speakers on this event, who are globally recognized for their creative genius that were eager to challenge this notion and to present creativity as something that everyone can and should strive for. As Jon Howard (Exec Product Manager for BBC, @swingpants) pointed out creativity is more a result of hard work and drawing connecting lines between the dots of your experience and knowledge. <a href=\"http://www.studiomoross.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Moross</a> who now makes the album covers for many cool labels, and <a href=\"http://blog.signalnoise.com\" target=\"_blank\">James White</a> whose illustrations led him to working with clients like Toyota, MTV and more, have a lot to say about the process and the hard work to get there. They wandered for a while, experimented with their work, before settling for the style that makes them unique and brings them the big clients.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7055\" src=\"http://blog.siteground.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dots2.jpg\" alt=\"dots2\" width=\"540\" height=\"262\" /></p>\n<h3>Creativity requires courage to be yourself</h3>\n<p>When you add some courage to the hard work you are on the right track! Many people work jobs that give them financial stability and security, but don’t make them happy and don’t allow them to develop their true potential and creativity. If you feel you are selling your soul for hire, you may be inspired by Sara Blake, a graphics designer and artist from New York, who made amazing large scale murals for the Footlocker Nike House of Hoops Store in New York City. She urges you: “Don’t wait for someone to hire you to do work”.</p>\n<p>Many people feel that employers and customers put limitations to their creativity. And from my standpoint of a project manager working with designers, I would say: yes, in every commercial project there are business objectives, apart from the pure aesthetic pleasure. However, you should not be afraid of having your own distinctive style and ideas. People doing design are not just instruments in the hands of the business people. We do things together, each of us bringing our unique expertise. When the aimed business goal matches the designer&#8217;s unique style, the best results are achieved.</p>\n<h3>Creativity is not afraid of criticism</h3>\n<p>If you feel inspired to make the leap in the dark, unleashing yourself, you should be aware that criticism and disapproval are inevitable, but if you accept the good and the bad as sources of learning, you’ll most probably learn faster. <a href=\"http://www.jamesvictore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">James Victore</a>, whose art is full of social causes and powerful messages, said “you have no friends, no enemies, just good teachers”.</p>\n<p>So if you think you carry that creativity bean inside you that needs to be uncovered, Reasons To Be Creative will challenge you to stop being an artist in disguise, hired by someone to do anything else but the work you really want to do. You can hear so many amazing, real-life stories of wonderful artists that there is no way you get out of this event without some courage to do the things you like. I hope you will also be as stoked as I was.</p>\n<p>You can see pictures from Reasons to be Creative in our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152277966522007.1073741854.43726922006&#038;type=3\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook album</a>. </p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/SCh0v2hlRr8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://blog.siteground.com/stoked-by-reasons-to-be-creative/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://blog.siteground.com/stoked-by-reasons-to-be-creative/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"SiteGround Customers Protected Against Serious VirtueMart Vulnerability!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/-DbzG2-Fi1A/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"http://blog.siteground.com/virtuemart-vulnerability/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 13:12:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WordPress, Joomla, etc.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=7036\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:382:\"A serious vulnerability in the popular Joomla extension VirtueMart was discovered by the awesome people at Sucuri during one of their regular security audits.

With all the innovations introduced on the spot, we were excited by the great opportunity it gives us to further improve our hosting service.

This will speed up issue resolutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The move to the new facility is one of our most exciting tech projects this quarter and has been carefully planned in details over the past few months. The first 35 dedicated servers have already been physically moved to the new location without any issues and are already successfully running from there.</p>\n<p>All customers that are now hosted in our US location will be personally notified with more information by email at least 5 days before their particular accounts will be moved. Some of the servers will be transferred over the wire, without physical move of the machines, while others will be switched off and moved physically to the new location. The majority of the transfers will be scheduled during the weekend nights, as this is the less active period for most of the websites. During the transfer there will be a constant status update in the user area of the all customers, whose accounts are on the move.</p>\n<p>We are looking forward to moving to this great new facility and we will keep you informed all the way!</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/se5PJrOjtn4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://blog.siteground.com/chicago-data-center-migration/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2:\"26\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://blog.siteground.com/chicago-data-center-migration/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"SiteGround Reporting live from Affiliate Summit East\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/-yYxybNLp14/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"http://blog.siteground.com/affiliate-summit-east-2014/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:57:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Sponsorships and events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=6994\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:372:\"As any other marketing channel, affiliate marketing has its tips and tricks, and it takes know-how and experience to be good at it.

That is why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissyWard\" target=\"_blank\">Missy Ward</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/affiliatetip\" target=\"_blank\">Shawn Collins</a> have undertaken the difficult task of helping affiliates and merchants share knowledge and find new business opportunities by organizing the <a href=\"http://www.affiliatesummit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Affiliate Summit conference</a> that happens twice a year – on the East and on the West coast of the USA. The most recent Affiliate Summit just happened in New York, from August 10th to August 12th, and our team was quite excited to attend it. This year in New York, the learning focus was on how to maintain an affiliate website and get traffic to it.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-6994\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>What is affiliate marketing? </strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>For those of you who don’t know what affiliate marketing is – that’s when you (acting as an affiliate) refer third-party products on your website and get paid for driving them sales. It looks easy to do it – place a banner on your website with a unique affiliate link that the merchant will provide for you and when some of your visitors click and buy from the merchant, you will get a commission. Pretty straightforward, right? Yet, if you want to be serious about it and actually make money from it, you may have to learn a thing or two and that’s why going to an Affiliate summit is really useful.</p>\n<p><strong>How to start and maintain an affiliate website?</strong></p>\n<p>It seems the most natural way to get started with the affiliate marketing is by starting a blog. Thus just as naturally one of the hottest keywords out there was “WordPress”. David Vogelpohl (<a href=\"http://www.marketingclique.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing Clique</a>) and <a href=\"http://jeremypalmer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Palmer</a> made a speech about the ultimate “toolkit” of plugins and optimizations needed to be a successful affiliate using WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adamriemer.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Riemer</a> on the other hand explained the ways to monetize your website going into specifics like where to place your ads and how to make more money out of them.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to get traffic?</strong></p>\n<p>All good, but if your site gets no visitors, there is no one you could send to buy the products you advertise. <a href=\"http://sugarrae.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rae Hoffman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.martinibuster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Montti</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottpolk\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Polk</a>, and quite a few other experts will help you with that and show you how to do SEO and link building for more traffic. You will hear lots of advanced terms like “negative SEO” and “reverse content marketing”, which sound quite complicated, but all in all, it’s a lot about following Google’s best practices and building links to your website that are as natural as possible, meaning people have a good reason to link to you, other than being paid to do so.</p>\n<p>The best of these reasons is that you are someone worth quoting and linking to. Thus the ultimate advice of the experts that already make a 6-digit revenue from affiliate marketing is to start building a brand for yourself. If you listen to <a href=\"http://www.johnchow.com\" target=\"_blank\">John Chow</a> it looks kinda easy, but if you hear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnrampton\" target=\"_blank\">John Rampton</a> and how he wrote 6 articles a day, you may want to think twice. Point is, affiliate marketing is a continuous work.</p>\n<p>Matthew Woodward, a British blogger with the authoritative website <a href=\"http://matthewwoodward.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">matthewwoodward.co.uk</a> wrapped it up nicely by providing a more strategic view on the process and how all actions you need to take are related. Building trust with quality content and no-bullshit approach is his way to make visitors come over and over again and listen to your product recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>Our advice for SiteGround affiliates</strong></p>\n<p>If you are serious about making money through affiliate marketing do not miss any opportunity to visit Affiliate Summits. There you will not only listen to people that are already successful, but you will be able to network and talk personally with them. Though affiliate marketing is largely an online activity, real face-to-face and personal relationships with the people that are the trend-setters in the community is the best shortcut to becoming successful on the affiliate market!</p>\n<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/siteground/~4/-yYxybNLp14\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://blog.siteground.com/affiliate-summit-east-2014/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"http://blog.siteground.com/affiliate-summit-east-2014/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:6:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress &amp; Drupal Vulnerability? –  Keep calm and update!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/siteground/~3/P_z_eqQWe_w/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://blog.siteground.com/wordpress-drupal-vulnerability/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:04:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"WordPress, Joomla, etc.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://blog.siteground.com/?p=6971\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:377:\"Yesterday, a serious vulnerability in the PHP XML parser used by WordPress and Drupal was announced.

Yet, this was our first time we sponsored <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014\" target=\"_blank\">OSCON</a> – the biggest conference about everything open source, that happened in Portland last week.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-6934\"></span></p>\n<h3>We shared our knowledge…</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.siteground.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/irinchev.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6947\" src=\"http://blog.siteground.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/irinchev-126x126.jpg\" alt=\"irinchev\" width=\"126\" height=\"126\" /></a>The scope of the event and the amount of information that flew around was amazing. One could really see and meet the best of the best from all major IT companies (using or developing open source software) sending teams and speakers there. That is why we were very proud to have our Head of the Development Team – Mihail Irintchev <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/MihailIrintchev/buildeploying-php-applications\" target=\"_blank\">talk about his currently favorite Phing</a> – a tool that helps our development team streamline the app building process and minimize the code errors. And believe me, coming from the project management side of it, this phing is a good thing!</p>\n<p>One of the hottest topics at OSCON was the container-based server technology. Our Chief System Architect – Marian Marinov had a great BOF (birds of a feather session) where he and his quite knowledgeable audience discussed some poignant problems with the Linux containers, sharing ideas on how they resolved them. You probably wonder what does Marian know about Linux containers, as our current platform is not built on such? Well, it’s not that we’ve kept it a secret, just didn’t really had the chance to talk about it yet, but for the last 6 months Marian and his team have been working hard to develop a highly scalable and redundant hosting platform on Linux containers. It won’t be long before you hear more of that platform and how it will add value to our service.</p>\n<h3>&#8230;and we had fun!</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.siteground.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/renidima.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6955\" src=\"http://blog.siteground.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/renidima-126x126.jpg\" alt=\"renidima\" width=\"126\" height=\"126\" /></a>And of course a serious conference like OSCON always comes with some serious party time. It started the first evening with an electrifying “Glow Run”, where we all had to run (some of us mostly walk) 5K in some of those glittering bracelets (and other accessories for those who wanted to go wild). Then we kept it going with a fun jenga game at our booth, awarding both the most skillful player who moved 26 pieces in 2 minutes without breaking the tower and the luckiest one who won the raffle for a Pebble watch. Finally, our team ended up OSCON with a great local craft beer at the impressive 27th Oregon Brew Fest. Technically, the Brew Fest wasn’t part of the OSCON, but the two events coincided so conveniently in Portland that we just couldn&#8217;t miss it. Mihail, a huge fan of craft beer and a huge fan of sharing a good drink with a good company, invited the most active members of his session’s audience for a beer at the Brew Fest to award them for their active participation and wonderful questions.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we love Open Source and we loved OSCON just as much!

Tripp, Executive Director/Founder</b>\r\n\r\nAyasha  is an energetic and passionate young woman who comes from the small town of Pittsburg, CA – the outskirts of the bustling San Francisco Bay Area. She\'s been writing stories since she was 7. Her passion and love for writing, film and theatre led her to pursue a degree in Television/Film New Media from San Diego State University. In her four and half years of attending SDSU she had the opportunity to study abroad in Singapore at Nanyang Technological University and study new media and film. She has written and directed two short films entitled, \'Unidentified\' and \'Bowling from Behind.\' In her last year attending SDSU, in association with the African American Student Drama Association she was granted the opportunity to produce/direct/write her first full length 3-Act play entitled, \'The Skin I’m In.\' The play was a huge success on her campus and sparked the idea for her to create Don\'t Even Tripp Productions. In the spring of 2010, her newly founded production company released her 2nd full length play \'and an Angel Came Down\' which premiered at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek, CA. The play was received very well, selling out the 2nd night! Half of the ticket proceeds were donated to the Youth Uprising Center of Oakland, CA.  After the production Tripp relocated to Chicago to expand her knowledge on theatre and writing. She had the opportunity to work as a Development Associate at the Writers Theatre. She was also under the mentorship of playwright Gloria Bond Clunie and Director  Chuck Smith and was granted the opportunity to work as their stage manager for the stage reading for the play <em>Smoke. </em>Ayasha has just recently graduated with her Masters in Afro American Studies  from the University of Wisconsin Madison. During her time on campus she worked closely with Patrick Sims founder of TCSA(Theatre for Culture &amp; Social Awareness) and hosted the WSUM radio show\"The Velvet Rope Radio Hour\" She has the opportunity to teach creative writing and theatre at UW Madison, Writers in Prison Project, and UC Berkeley Upward Bound Program. She is now back home in the Bay Area and is beyond ready to take Don\'t Even Tripp to the next level. \"I just want to help people tap into their purpose and passion and I believe theatre that can do that\"!\r\n\r\n<b>Asia Jackson, Literary Manager</b>\r\n\r\nAsia Jackson is an actress and avid lover of theatre who is also  from the Bay Area, CA. Upon entering college at San Diego State, she, like so many prospective and freshman college students, did not know what she wanted to do. She pre-majored in business with an emphasis in management. However, her sophomore year, she randomly auditioned in a student-written play, and was cast as the lead. The play was a success on campus, and afterwards, she discovered her passion...acting. Her junior year of college, she changed her major from business to theatre arts with an emphasis in performance. She also minored in film so that she could learn the aesthetics of film. She became president of the African Student Drama Association and was cast in The Vagina Monologues and Hamlet: Blood in the Brain on campus. In the summer of 2008 she was cast in The Body Washer at Compass Theatre in San Diego. After graduating college in December of 2008, she was cast in her first professional theatre show Bulrusher, at New Village Arts Theatre in Carlsbad. Outside of working with Don’t Even Tripp Asia is actively pursuing her career in acting in Chicago,IL.\r\n\r\n<b>Arielle Vaughan, Director of Community Engagement/Creative Aide to Executive Director</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Damon Hastings, Director of Artistic Design</b>\r\n\r\nDo you want to work with Don’t Even Tripp?

	(4,3,'2014-08-22 03:47:28','0000-00-00 00:00:00','Founded in early 2009, Don\'t Even Tripp Productions is a theatrical production company that was established by Writer/Director/Educator Ayasha J. Tripp. After receiving her B.S. in Film &amp; New Media at San Diego State University, Tripp banded together with close friends (Arielle Vaughan &amp; Asia Jackson) to establish an organization that would present powerful new works that people of diverse backgrounds could connect with. We were inspired to shed led light on topics that were current yet not being discussed in theatre.\r\n\r\nOur core belief system as an organization is to go beyond the expected and portray a variety of stories that speak personally to individual backgrounds. We make theatre accessible for today’s modern generation. Our productions challenge societal norms, and bring into question issues regarding race, religion, education, politics, etc. We entertain, but more importantly we educate and empower. The goal is to create theatre that will spark dialogue and motivate people to think critically. We use theatre as a means to bring the community together.\r\n\r\nReason behind the name:\r\n\r\nOutside of the fact that the name of the company embodies the family name, Tripp, one of the reasons we decided to name the company Don\'t Even Tripp was to reflect our perspective and attitude towards the challenges of producing quality theatre that may come our way. Meaning, despite what challenges or barriers we are presented with, we refuse to succumb to the pressure or setbacks of life. In our culture, to trip, is to worry and have anxiety over something.

She has written and directed two short films entitled, \'Unidentified\' and \'Bowling from Behind.\' In her last year attending SDSU, in association with the African American Student Drama Association she was granted the opportunity to produce/direct/write her first full length 3-Act play entitled, \'The Skin I’m In.\' The play was a huge success on her campus and sparked the idea for her to create Don\'t Even Tripp Productions. In the spring of 2010, her newly founded production company released her 2nd full length play \'and an Angel Came Down\' which premiered at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek, CA. The play was received very well, selling out the 2nd night!

	(19,2,'2014-08-20 03:13:12','2014-08-20 03:13:12','Founded in early 2009, Don\'t Even Tripp Productions is a theatrical production company that was established by Writer/Director/Educator Ayasha J. Tripp.  After receiving her B.S. in Film &amp; New Media at San Diego State University, Tripp banded together with close friends(Arielle Vaughan &amp; Asia Jackson) to establish an organization that would present powerful new works that people of diverse backgrounds could connect with.  We were tired of the seeing the same stories being told and wanted to shed led light on topics that were current but were not being discussed in theatre.\n\nOur core belief system as an organization is to go beyond the expected and portray a variety of stories that speak personally to individual backgrounds. We make theatre accessible for today’s modern generation. Our productions challenge societal norms, and bring into question issues regarding race, religion, education, politics, and etc. We entertain but more importantly we educate and empower. The goal is to create theatre that will spark dialogue and motivate people to think critically. We use theatre as a means to bring the community together.\n\nReason behind the name:\n\nOutside of the fact that the name of the company embodies the family name, Tripp, one of the reasons we decided to name the company Don\'t Even Tripp was to reflect our perspective and attitude towards the challenges of producing quality theatre that may come our way. Meaning, despite what challenges or barriers we are presented with, we are not the type of company to succumb to the pressure or setbacks of life. In our culture, to trip, is to worry and have anxiety over something. Don\'t Even Tripp basically means: Don’t even worry about it. We will conquer, prevail, and always provide a 100% in all productions we offer to our audience. With enough faith, persistence, and commitment to the company and community, we believe we can overcome any obstacle that may come our way. So basically, we\'re not worried about what is to come, we\'re ready for it and willing to give our all in what we do. We’re ready to work for you…our community\n\nIf you like what you see, please do not hesitate to contact us! We are talented group of open- minded, loving, creative people who have an extreme passion for theatre/film and the arts! Thanks for checking us out and we look forward to hearing from you.\n\nMuch Love,\n\nDon\'t Even Tripp Staff','About Us','','inherit','open','open','','4-autosave-v1','','','2014-08-20 03:13:12','2014-08-20 03:13:12','',4,'http://donteventripp.com/?p=19',0,'revision','',0),

In her four and half years of attending SDSU she had the opportunity to study abroad in Singapore at Nanyang Technological University and study new media and film. She has written/directed two short films entitled, \'Unidentified\' and \'Bowling from Behind.\' In her last year attending SDSU, in association with the African American Student Drama Association she was granted the opportunity to produce/direct/write her first full length 3-Act play entitled, \'The Skin I’m In.\' The play was a huge success on her campus and sparked the idea for her to create Don\'t Even Tripp Productions. In the spring of 2010, her newly founded production company released her 2nd full length play \'and an Angel Came Down\' which premiered at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek, CA. The play was received very well, selling out the 2nd night! Half of the ticket proceeds were donated to the Youth Uprising Center of Oakland, CA.  After the production Tripp relocated to Chicago to expand her knowledge on theatre and writing. She had the opportunity to work as a Development Associate at the Writers Theatre. She was also under the mentorship of playwright Gloria Bond Clunie and Director  Chuck Smith and was granted the opportunity to work as their stage manager for the stage reading for the play <em>Smoke. </em>Ayasha has just recently graduated with her Masters in Afro American Studies  from the University of Wisconsin Madison.

However, her sophomore year, she randomly auditioned in a student-written play, and was cast as the lead. The play was a success on campus, and afterwards, she discovered her passion...acting. Her junior year of college, she changed her major from business to theatre arts with an emphasis in performance. She also minored in film so that she could learn the aesthetics of film. She became president of the African Student Drama Association and was cast in The Vagina Monologues and Hamlet: Blood in the Brain on campus. In the summer of 2008 she was cast in The Body Washer at Compass Theatre in San Diego.

One from the mean streets of  Compton, CA - the other who is from the sheltered areas of Beverly Hills who has white adoptive parents. This comedy/drama focuses on issues of race, identity, acceptance, and unity.\r\n\r\n<b><i>“and an Angel Came Down”</i></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Production Date: </b>April 23rd &amp; 24th, 2010\r\n\r\n<b>Premier Location: </b>Lesher Center for the Arts - Walnut Creek, CA\r\n\r\n<b>Writer/Director: </b>Ayasha Tripp\r\n\r\n<b>Synopsis: </b>The story of young man who is dealing with the murder of his younger sister, and even though he claims to be at peace and received spiritual healing through God, in reality he is masking with his pain with an addiction to pain killers. The play would be categorized as a drama, with a great deal of comic relief. It will bring to the audience’s attention issues of dealing with forgiveness, confronting past problems, and most importantly, addressing the issue of not just talking in our faith but instead, walking in it.\r\n\r\n<b>Link for the playbill:</b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://issuu.com/oneofonedesign/docs/angelprogram\">http://issuu.com/oneofonedesign/docs/angelprogram</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Past Productions','','inherit','open','open','','8-revision-v1','','','2014-08-22 04:26:40','2014-08-22 04:26:40','',8,'http://donteventripp.com/?p=33',0,'revision','',0),

It was an ironic feeling because the social issues that Baldwin was discussing were directed for the people of the 1960\'s. Yet, at the time I read his book (Fall 2013), I felt as if his messages and ideas were still applicable for today\'s generation. And sadly enough, the quote above matches perfectly to the inhumane treatment that certain black bodies have had a history of dealing with and STILL continue to deal with in today\'s modern society.\r\n\r\nI have made an effort to observe, read, question, analyze, and even ponder all of the different responses about the Mike Brown issue and the recent Eric Garner decision. It is quite obvious there are number of people who feel beyond hopeless, frustrated beyond measure, and simply just tired…So tired that some may even feel compelled to give up. Perhaps even consider something like this....\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41\" src=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-300x276.jpg\" alt=\"-1\" width=\"300\" height=\"276\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\nBut what I found most troubling, is the people who refuse to acknowledge the PROBLEM and HISTORY in regards to the treatment of black bodies and the police. People are saying \"set your clocks back 300 years\" as if this type of treatment is old and outdated... when in reality...you don\'t have to go back that far to acknowledge that this has been ONGOING problem for some time now! You can set it back to 31 years ago with Michael Stewart(1983) or 5 years ago to Oscar Grant(2009). Yet people want to act as if this is not a problem and spew ignorant statements such as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Race is not an issue!\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn\'t a problem with the police!\"\r\n\r\n\"These people get what they deserved! They shouldn\'t have been breaking the law\"\r\n\r\n\"The system DOES work!\"\r\n\r\nAll of the above statements left me with the following expression:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-45 aligncenter\" src=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ew1-300x224.gif\" alt=\"ew\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" />\r\n\r\nBut all jokes aside, let\'s get one thing straight. The fact is, what is happening now in 2014 has been happening FOR DECADES! The issue does not begin with Mike Brown or Eric Garner. Unbeknownst to some people, there has been an ongoing HISTORY of the police showing no type of respect, honor, or value for the lives of black people in this country.

She has written and directed two short films entitled, \'Unidentified\' and \'Bowling from Behind.\' In her last year attending SDSU, in association with the African American Student Drama Association she was granted the opportunity to produce/direct/write her first full length 3-Act play entitled, \'The Skin I’m In.\' The play was a huge success on her campus and sparked the idea for her to create Don\'t Even Tripp Productions. In the spring of 2010, her newly founded production company released her 2nd full length play \'and an Angel Came Down\' which premiered at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek, CA. The play was received very well, selling out the 2nd night! Half of the ticket proceeds were donated to the Youth Uprising Center of Oakland, CA.  After the production Tripp relocated to Chicago to expand her knowledge on theatre and writing. She had the opportunity to work as a Development Associate at the Writers Theatre. She was also under the mentorship of playwright Gloria Bond Clunie and Director  Chuck Smith and was granted the opportunity to work as their stage manager for the stage reading for the play <em>Smoke. </em>Ayasha has just recently graduated with her Masters in Afro American Studies  from the University of Wisconsin Madison.

It was an ironic feeling because the social issues that Baldwin was discussing were directed for the people of the 1960\'s. Yet, at the time I read his book (Fall 2013), I felt as if his messages and ideas were still applicable for today\'s generation. And sadly enough, the quote above matches perfectly to the inhumane treatment that certain black bodies have had a history of dealing with and STILL continue to deal with in today\'s modern society.\r\n\r\nI have made an effort to observe, read, question, analyze, and even ponder all of the different responses about the Mike Brown issue and the recent Eric Garner decision. It is quite obvious there are number of people who feel beyond hopeless, frustrated beyond measure, and simply just tired…So tired that some may even feel compelled to give up. Perhaps even consider something like this....\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41\" src=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1-300x276.jpg\" alt=\"-1\" width=\"300\" height=\"276\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\nBut what I found most troubling, is the people who refuse to acknowledge the PROBLEM and HISTORY in regards to the treatment of black bodies and the police. People are saying \"set your clocks back 300 years\" as if this type of treatment is old and outdated... when in reality...you don\'t have to go back that far to acknowledge that this has been ONGOING problem for some time now! You can set it back to 31 years ago with Michael Stewart(1983) or 5 years ago to Oscar Grant(2009). Yet people want to act as if this is not a problem and spew ignorant statements such as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Race is not an issue!\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn\'t a problem with the police!\"\r\n\r\n\"These people get what they deserved! They shouldn\'t have been breaking the law\"\r\n\r\n\"The system DOES work!\"\r\n\r\nAll of the above statements left me with the following expression:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-45 aligncenter\" src=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ew1-300x224.gif\" alt=\"ew\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" />\r\n\r\nBut all jokes aside, let\'s get one thing straight. The fact is, what is happening now in 2014 has been happening FOR DECADES! The issue does not begin with Mike Brown or Eric Garner. Unbeknownst to some people, there has been an ongoing HISTORY of the police showing no type of respect, honor, or value for the lives of black people in this country. The truth of the matter is, the police have been patrolling, killing, and targeting people of color way before you or even I, were able to make a facebook opinion about the issue.\r\n\r\nMyself and the rest of the Don’t Even Tripp staff are committed to using our ART to bring awareness, discourse, and TRUTH to these problems our society is dealing with. Don’t Even Tripp’s next production: <i>Generation of Dreams </i>highlights these topical issues and even brings up the HISTORICAL facts that demonstrate how our past correlates with our present.\r\n\r\nWe decided to launch the website today <b>December 4th</b> because this day holds historical significance in regards to the treatment of black bodies in relation to the police. Today marks the 44th year anniversary of the assassination of Black Panther Leader Fred Hampton.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Fred_Hampton.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-40 aligncenter\" src=\"http://donteventripp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Fred_Hampton-289x300.png\" alt=\"Fred_Hampton\" width=\"289\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\r\nFred Hampton was chairman of the Black Panther Illinois chapter. He rallied for peace &amp; progression for ALL people and was most recognized for his involvement in the rainbow collation. A movement that prompted Chicago Gangs to end violence and draw peace with one another. Unfortunately, Hampton was murdered when the Chicago police raided his home while he was sleeping on the night of December 4th 1969. The raid was led by FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover and his task force COINTELPRO. A group dedicated to dismantling peaceful political organizations.\r\n\r\nBu don\'t take my word for it...Do your own research. Here are some helpful articles to get you started\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Click Here\" href=\"%20http://www.democracynow.org/2009/12/4/the_assassination_of_fred_hampton_how\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.democracynow.org/2009/12/4/the_assassination_of_fred_hampton_how</a>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chicagoreviewpress.com/assassination-of-fred-hampton--the-products-9781556527654.php\r\n\r\nOr if you don’t like to read, here is a film:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAFyLpvOjyw\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Murder-Fred-Hampton/dp/B000O75GWQ\r\n\r\nI am by no ways advocating that ALL police are bad. However, to not acknowledge the history, the facts, and apparent outrage of a community who is tried and fed up of the ongoing injustice is simply not fair or correct. Regardless of race, political, or social standing, as an active contributing citizen of this society, it is important to recognize that this issue does matter!\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t Even Tripp makes a vow to address, acknowledge, and fully confront social issues like these in our productions.\r\n<center>So not only STAY TUNED for our next production....\r\n\r\nbut more importantly\r\n\r\n<center><b>STAY INVOLVED, INFORMED, AND ACTIVE</b></center>\r\n\"You can kill a revolutionary but you can never kill the revolution.\"\r\n-Fred Hampton\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of motivating people to get more involved Don’t Even Tripp Plans to donate 25% of their ticket proceeds to the <a href=\"http://ellabakercenter.org/\">Ella Baker Center</a> of Oakland, CA.</center>&nbsp;','D.E.T Supports #BLACKLIVES & The Legacy of Fred Hampton','','inherit','open','open','','39-revision-v1','','','2014-12-04 18:30:00','2014-12-04 18:30:00','',39,'http://donteventripp.com/?p=106',0,'revision','',0);
